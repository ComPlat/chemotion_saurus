Each button (see below) represents a mathematical or logical operation.
Click on a button to add the corresponding symbol or function to the text area titled _Operation_.

This can include arithmetic operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`; math functions like `log`, `sqrt`, or `exp`; and other operators such as comparisons (`>`, `==`, etc.) and random number functions (`dnorm`, `runif`, etc.).

## Direct Input

- You’re free to type directly into the _Operation_ text area if that’s easier or if you want to write custom expressions.
- This flexibility lets you build complex operations or modify existing ones without relying solely on the buttons.

---

## Intermediate Variables

- After entering an operation, you can run it and store it as an intermediate result
  by clicking the _Run operation and store intermediate results_ button.
- In the _Intermediate variable name_ field, enter a name for the intermediate result.
- This stores the result for further use within your operations without immediately appending it to your dataset.
- Intermediate variables are useful for breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts.

---

## Appending to Dataset

- To add the operation result as a new column in your dataset, use the _Run operation and append to dataset_ button.
- Specify the column name in the _New column name_ field, and the output will be appended to your dataset under this name.
- This is helpful for creating and saving computed columns directly into the data for easy access and analysis.
