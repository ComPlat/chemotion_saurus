- Download CSV (Rf values)
- Download annotated image (PNG)
- Upload both (CSV and annotated image) to the Chemotion (if image was from Chemotion)

##  3. Upload to Chemotion

If the image was originally loaded from the Chemotion:

- Use the  **Upload to Chemotion** button
- The tool sends both the annotated image and CSV to the original Chemotion URL

:::danger[Requirements]
- **Image Source Restriction**
  Only images loaded from the Chemotion support cloud upload.
  If you upload an image locally (i.e., not from the Chemotion), the annotated image cannot be uploaded back to the Chemotion.

- **CSRF Token**
  A valid CSRF token must be available. This is handled internally by the system.
