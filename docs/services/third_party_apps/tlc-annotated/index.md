# TLC Image Annotation Tool

# Overview

The **TLC Image Annotation Tool** is a lightweight web-based app integrated into the **Chemotion ELN**, designed to annotate Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) plates, calculate Rf values, and export annotated results.

This tool helps digitize TLC documentation, automate RF calculations, and ensure consistent and clean ELN entries.
