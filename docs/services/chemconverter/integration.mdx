# ELN integration

The Chemotion Converter is integrated as a background process, so the user will not notice it but by the presence of additional files along the original.
If using a file of your inbox that comes from an integrated device, you should use the ChemConverter-produced file (if a conversion is necessary / possible for this kind of file).
To do so, just drag & drop it from the inbox to the wanted field of the ELN GUI.
The exact workflow is shown in the animated picture.

:::warning[warning]
Note that drag-n-dropping the original file only from the inbox into an analysis will not trigger the converter if the converter already has processed it and deposited the resulting zip along the original.
To keep the original and trigger the spectra view, the user should move both files into an analysis dataset.
