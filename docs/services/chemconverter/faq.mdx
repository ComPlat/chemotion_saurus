## Troubleshooting

#### I cannot create a profile on the admin GUI (Webserver does nothing or ERROR Message)

- **Answer:** There can be multiple reasons, but the most common are:

  - You are trying to upload a binary file (not supported yet!)
  - There's no reader (yet) for your specific data type and the standard reader don't work either.
  - You are in the wrong menu, please press the right button. <br/> <img src="/img/converter/dontImport.svg" alt="Please do not click import, create instead" width="400" height="200" />

#### I created a profile for my data file on the admin GUI but after uploading it to the ELN it will not be converted.

- **Answer:** If you are sure, that the reason is not the converter itself (because you tested it on a standalone version and it works), we need to add your file extension/type to our whitelist. Please let us know.

#### Even after choosing a suitable [data type](../chemconverter#data-type) (and a correct conversion) the ELN says "Preview not available" and/or "Spectra Editor: Reprocess"

![Preview not available](/img/converter/naPreview.png)

- **Answer:** The two common mistakes occur if there

  - was a freeze, loose of connection or other bug during the upload or the conversion process. You can try to click on the orange button to regenerate the spectra.
  - isn't a working layout for this technique yet. You can wait for the next update and try again later or help us with your expertise to create a suitable layout.

- **Workaround:** Just to have basic features for looking at the curves, an already more accomplished layout like CV, UV/VIS or NMR is recommended to be used.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### Why using .jdx and not e.g. .csv for the converter output?

- **Answer:** There are mostly two reasons:

  1. Jcamp .jdx is well know and used among chemists and companies (like Bruker), belongs to the IUPAC and it's [standardized with multiple extensions](https://doi.org/10.1366/0003702884428734).
  2. [CSV is it not!](https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC4180)

#### What data formats are supported as input

- **Short answer:** Mostly all common non-binary files (txt, csv, dta ...) are at least with basic feature. 

- **Long answer:** We encourage you to look at the [reader documentation page](readers). Here you will also find a list of readers with advanced features.

#### I'm a (LabView, Simulink, Matlab ...) developer, coder or IT person. Are there any guidelines how to design the output files of my test stand / experiment / script?

- **Answer:** Of course there are and we are happy to help you against closed, unreadable and proprietary data! Therefore, a document with simple and basic guidelines (currently in beta status) was created.
