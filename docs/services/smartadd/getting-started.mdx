# Getting Started with SmartAdd

Welcome! Let's get you up and running with SmartAdd. It's easier than you think.

## What You'll Need

Don't worry - the requirements are simple:

- **Modern Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (any recent version works great)
- **Your Data**: Analytical data files or ZIP archives of your datasets
- **That's It!**: No installation needed. SmartAdd runs right in your browser, and your data is automatically saved in browser storage so you won't lose anything when you refresh the page. 

## Let's Get Started

### 1. Open SmartAdd

Just open SmartAdd in your browser. You'll see a simple, clean interface:
- **Left Side**: Where you'll upload files and find action buttons
- **Right Side**: Your workspace with the tree view and editor

### 2. Upload Your Data

You can upload data in two ways - pick whichever feels easier:

#### Individual Files
Just drag your analytical files into the "Drag files here" area. That's it! SmartAdd processes them instantly and shows you the organized structure.

#### ZIP Archive (We Recommend This!)
Got a bunch of files? Package them in a ZIP first, then drag the ZIP into SmartAdd. It'll automatically extract and organize everything for you.

:::tip[Why ZIP Files?]
ZIP archives make life easier when you're working with:
- Lots of files at once
- Complex folder structures you want to preserve
- Large datasets (uploads faster as a single file)
- Related files that need to stay together
:::

### 3. Explore Your Data

Once your files are uploaded, you'll see them organized as an interactive tree on the right side:
- Click on any item to select it
- Use the arrow icons to expand or collapse branches
- The hierarchy usually goes: **Reactions** → **Samples** → **Analyses** → **Analysis** → **Dataset** → **Files**

It's intuitive - just click around and explore!

### 4. Make Your First Edit

Ready to edit something? Here's how:
1. Click on any sample, reaction, or analysis in the tree
2. A properties panel appears with fields you can edit
3. Click on any field and start typing
4. Your changes save automatically - no "Save" button needed!

### 5. Send Your Data to Chemotion

When you're happy with your organized data, you have two ways to export:

#### Download as ZIP
The classic approach:
1. Review everything looks good
2. Click **Download as ZIP**
3. Save the file
4. Upload it to Chemotion whenever you're ready

#### Direct Upload (The New Way!)
Skip the middleman:
1. Click **Upload to Chemotion ELN**
2. Enter your Chemotion server URL
3. Log in with your credentials
4. SmartAdd sends everything directly - done!
