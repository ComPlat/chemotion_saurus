# SmartAdd

SmartAdd is a web-based companion for Chemotion that helps researchers import, organize, and prepare chemical data before sending it into Chemotion.
Instead of wrestling with complex file structures or scattered files, SmartAdd gives you a clear, visual tree view to curate your collection.

## Overview

SmartAdd streamlines the process of preparing research data for the Chemotion ELN. With its intuitive drag-and-drop interface and visual tree editor,
you can quickly organize samples, reactions, and analytical data before exporting to Chemotion.

### Key Features

- **📤 Easy Upload**: Drag & drop files or ZIP archives
- **🌳 Visual Tree View**: See your data organized hierarchically
- **✏️ Inline Editing**: Edit sample, reaction, and analysis properties directly
- **🔗 Multi-Sample Reaction Support**: Add multiple samples to reactions with automatic smart sorting
- **✅ SMILES Validation**: Real-time molecular structure validation and syntax checking
- **🚀 Direct Chemotion Integration**: Upload directly to your Chemotion ELN server without manual downloads
- **📊 Dataset Management**: Control which datasets are included or excluded from export
- **📦 Export Ready**: Generate Chemotion-compatible ZIP files or upload directly
- **🌐 No Installation**: Runs entirely in your browser
