# SmartAdd

SmartAdd is a web-based companion for Chemotion that helps researchers import, organize, and prepare chemical data before sending it into Chemotion.
Instead of wrestling with complex file structures or scattered files, SmartAdd gives you a clear, visual tree view to curate your collection.

## Overview

SmartAdd streamlines the process of preparing research data for the Chemotion ELN. With its intuitive drag-and-drop interface and visual tree editor,
you can quickly organize samples, reactions, and analytical data before exporting to Chemotion.

### Key Features

- **📤 Easy Upload**: Drag & drop files or ZIP archives
- **🌳 Visual Tree View**: See your data organized hierarchically
- **✏️ Inline Editing**: Edit sample, reaction, and analysis properties directly
- **✏️ Rich Text Editing**: Quill editor for formatted descriptions with full text formatting capabilities
- **🎨 Structure Editor**: Integrated Ketcher molecular structure editor for creating and editing MOL files
- **🔗 Multi-Sample Reaction Support**: Add multiple samples to reactions with automatic smart sorting
- **✅ SMILES Validation**: Real-time molecular structure validation and syntax checking
- **🖼️ Reaction Tooltips**: Hover over reactions to preview reaction scheme images
- **✅ Enhanced Validation**: Real-time SMILES and MOL file validation with detailed error reporting
- **🌐 Excel Template Support**: Use our Excel template format to auto-generate collection structure (samples, reactions)
- **📦 Chemscanner Integration**: Import Chemscanner export.json/zip to auto-generate collection structure
- **🚀 Direct Chemotion Integration**: Upload directly to your Chemotion ELN server with secure authentication

## Quick Start

New to SmartAdd? Follow these steps:

### Manual Workflow:
1. **Upload Analytical Files**: Drag & drop analytical data files or ZIP archives—they appear in the input list (left)
2. **Create Structure**: Use "Add Sample" and "Add Reaction" buttons to build your collection manually (right panel)
3. **Assign Files**: Drag analytical files from the input list (left) to samples/analyses in the tree (right)
4. **Edit Properties**: Click nodes to edit sample/reaction properties, validate SMILES, assign roles
5. **Export**: Download as ZIP or upload directly to Chemotion ELN

### Auto-Generate Workflow:
1. **Upload Chemscanner ZIP or Excel Template**: Drag the file to auto-generate collection structure
2. **Review Structure**: Check auto-generated samples and reactions in the assignment tree (right)
3. **Assign Analytics**: Drag analytical files from input list to the generated samples/analyses
4. **Edit & Refine**: Adjust properties as needed
5. **Export**: Download as ZIP or upload directly to Chemotion ELN
