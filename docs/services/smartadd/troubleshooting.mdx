# Troubleshooting Guide

Having trouble? Don't worry - most issues have simple solutions. Here are the most common problems and how to fix them.

## Upload Problems

### My ZIP file won't upload

**Try these fixes:**
- Make sure your file isn't too large - try splitting it into smaller ZIPs
- Refresh your browser (`Ctrl+F5` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)
- Try a different browser (Chrome or Firefox work best)
- Check your internet connection

If the ZIP file seems corrupted, just recreate it and try again.

### I uploaded files but can't find them

Here's the thing: SmartAdd doesn't automatically organize your files. After uploading, you need to:
1. Look in the **input list** on the left - your files are there
2. Create samples and reactions using the buttons
3. **Drag files** from the left panel to the right tree

:::warning
Files that stay in the input list won't be exported! Make sure to drag everything you need to the assignment tree.
:::

## Editing Problems

### I can't edit anything

Make sure you're clicking on an actual item (like a sample or reaction), not a folder. The properties panel should appear on the right when you select something.

If fields still look grayed out, try refreshing your browser or updating to the latest version.

### My changes disappear

This usually happens when you switch to another item too quickly. To save your edits:
- Press `Enter` or `Tab` after typing
- Click outside the field
- Wait a moment before clicking somewhere else

### SMILES validation shows errors

The easiest fix: use a molecular structure editor like [Ketcher](https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/KetcherDemoSA/index.html) or ChemDraw to generate valid SMILES, then copy and paste into SmartAdd.

Common SMILES mistakes to avoid:
- Mismatched brackets or parentheses
- Typos in atom symbols
- Unclosed rings

## Export Issues

### Download button doesn't work

First, check if your browser is blocking the download:
- Look for a notification about blocked pop-ups
- Check your browser's download settings
- Try disabling ad blockers temporarily
- Use incognito/private mode

### My export is missing data

**This is the most common issue!**

Before exporting, check:
- Did you drag all files from the input list (left) to the assignment tree (right)?
- Are all your samples and reactions created?
- Expand the tree nodes - can you see all your files attached?

Remember: Only files in the assignment tree get exported!

### Direct upload to Chemotion isn't working

**Connection problems:**
- Double-check the server URL (should start with `https://`)
- Make sure you're on the right network (VPN if needed)
- Test the URL in your browser first

**Login issues:**
- Usernames and passwords are case-sensitive
- Try logging into Chemotion directly to verify your credentials
- Contact your Chemotion administrator if you're sure the credentials are correct

**Upload fails or times out:**
- Your collection might be too large - try breaking it into smaller batches
- Check your network connection
- As a backup, use "Download as ZIP" and import manually

## Performance Issues

### SmartAdd is running slow

Quick fixes:
- Close other browser tabs
- Clear your browser cache
- Restart your browser
- For very large projects (100+ samples), work in smaller batches

### Display looks weird

- Reset your browser zoom to 100% (`Ctrl+0` or `Cmd+0`)
- Make sure your browser window is large enough
- Try refreshing the page

## Still Stuck?

### Quick fixes to try first:
1. Refresh the page
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Try a different browser
4. Check the [video tutorial](../smartadd#complete-tutorial-video) for visual guidance

### Need more help?

When reaching out for support, it helps to include:
- What browser you're using
- What you were trying to do
- Any error messages you see (screenshots are great!)
- An example file if relevant

| Changes don't save | Press Enter or click outside field first |
| Invalid SMILES | Use Ketcher or ChemDraw to generate valid SMILES |
| Download blocked | Check pop-up blocker settings |
| Can't login to Chemotion | Verify credentials are case-sensitive and correct |
