# Tips & Best Practices

Here's what we've learned works best for SmartAdd. These tips will save you time and headaches.

## Before You Start

### Name Your Files Well

Here's the thing: you'll be building the folder structure manually in SmartAdd, so clear file names are your best friend.

**What makes a good file name?**
- Include the sample or compound identifier
- Specify the analysis type
- Add relevant parameters (like solvent or frequency)
- Be consistent with your naming style

#### File Naming Conventions

| Type | Good Example | Bad Example |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **NMR** | `compound_A_1H_NMR_400MHz_CDCl3.jdx` | `data.jdx` |
| **MS** | `sample_001_ESI_MS_positive.mzML` | `new_file_final_v3.mzML` |
| **IR** | `product_IR_KBr.jdx` | `spectrum@#$.jdx` |
| **Metadata** | `synthesis_notes_2024-01-15.txt` | `notes.txt` |

**Things to avoid:**
- ❌ Special characters like `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `&`
- ❌ Spaces (use underscores or hyphens)
- ❌ Generic names like `data`, `file`, `new`
- ❌ Version numbers unless you really need them (`_v1`, `_v2`, `_final`)

### Gather Everything First

Before you upload, collect all the files you'll need:
- 📊 **All your spectra** (NMR, MS, IR, etc.)
- 🧬 **Structure files** (MOL format, text)
- 📝 **Instrument logs**
- 📋 **Metadata** with experimental conditions
- 📄 **Any notes** (synthesis procedures, observations)

:::tip[Upload Strategy]
Whether you upload a ZIP or individual files, SmartAdd puts everything in an input list. Then you manually drag files to assign them to samples and analyses.

## While Using SmartAdd

### Work One Sample at a Time

Trust us on this - complete each sample fully before starting the next one:

1. Click **"Add Sample"**
2. Fill in the properties (name, SMILES, amount, etc.)
3. Drag files from the input list to this sample
4. Add analyses and attach the analytical files
5. Done? Move to the next sample

**Why this works better:**
- Fewer mistakes
- You can track your progress easily
- Less overwhelming when you have lots of data
- You won't forget to assign files

:::tip[Don't Forget!]
Drag files from the left panel (input list) to the right panel (assignment tree). If you don't assign a file, it won't be in your export!
:::

### Keep Names Consistent

Pick a naming style and stick with it throughout your project:

```
Samples: COMP_001, COMP_002, COMP_003
Reactions: RXN_Suzuki_001, RXN_Grignard_002
Analyses: NMR_1H_001, MS_ESI_001
```

### Check Your SMILES

SmartAdd validates SMILES in real-time:
- Type in your molecular structure using SMILES notation
- Look for the green indicator (valid) or red (invalid)
- Fix any errors before moving on
- Not sure about your SMILES? Use [ketcherDemo](https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/KetcherDemoSA/index.html) to generate a valid molfile

### Group Samples into Reactions

When you have a reaction with multiple samples:
- Add all relevant samples to the reaction
- Assign roles (reactant, product, solvent)
- SmartAdd will automatically sort them by role
- Set the reaction scheme type for better visualization

### Always Include Units

Numbers without units are meaningless. Always add them:

| Field | ❌ Without Units | ✅ With Units |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Amount | `100` | `100 mg` |
| Volume | `5` | `5 mL` |
| Time | `24` | `24 h` |
| Temperature | `25` | `25 °C` |

### Write Good Descriptions

Future you will thank present you for being descriptive:

**Samples:**
- ❌ "Sample A"
- ✅ "Suzuki coupling product, white solid, synthesized 2024-01-15"

**Reactions:**
- ❌ "Reaction 1"
- ✅ "Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling, RT, 24h, N₂ atmosphere, THF solvent"

**Analyses:**
- ❌ "NMR data"
- ✅ "¹H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl₃)"

### Master the Two-Panel Layout

**Left Panel (Input List):**
- This is where all your uploaded files live
- Drag files from here to assign them to samples

**Right Panel (Assignment Tree):**
- This is your workspace with samples and reactions
- Drag files here to attach them
- Click on any item to edit its properties

**Pro tip:** Expand the section you're working on, and collapse the ones you've finished. Keeps things tidy!

### How to Organize Your Tree

A well-organized tree looks like this:

```
✅ Good:
📦 Assignment Tree
  ├─ 🧪 Reaction: Suzuki Coupling
  │   ├─ 📋 Sample: Reactant A (role: reactant)
  │   │   └─ 📊 Analyses
  │   │       └─ 📊 1H NMR
  │   └─ 📋 Sample: Product B (role: product)
  │       └─ 📊 Analyses
  │           ├─ 📊 1H NMR
  │           └─ 📊 13C NMR
  └─ 📋 Sample: Standalone Sample
      └─ 📊 Analyses

❌ Avoid:
📦 Assignment Tree
  ├─ 📋 Sample (vague name)
  ├─ 📋 Sample (no files attached)
  └─ 🧪 Reaction (empty)
```

## Before You Export

### Quick Checklist

Before you click "Download as ZIP", run through this:

**Samples:**
- [ ] Unique, descriptive names
- [ ] SMILES validated (look for green indicator)
- [ ] Amounts with units
- [ ] Purity values (if applicable)
- [ ] Sample type defined
- [ ] Good descriptions

**Reactions:**
- [ ] Clear reaction names
- [ ] All samples added
- [ ] Roles assigned (reactant/product/solvent)
- [ ] Samples sorted by role
- [ ] Reaction scheme type set
- [ ] Conditions in description

**Analyses:**
- [ ] Analysis types categorized correctly
- [ ] Ontology terms selected
- [ ] All files attached
- [ ] Instrument parameters noted
- [ ] Status updated

### Common Mistakes

Watch out for these - they're easy to make:

| Mistake | The Problem | The Fix |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Invalid SMILES** | Wrong structures | Check for the green validation indicator |
| **Missing units** | Data becomes meaningless | Always include units with numbers |
| **Generic names** | Can't tell items apart | Use descriptive, unique names |
| **Unassigned roles** | Unclear what's what in reactions | Assign roles to all samples |
| **Files not assigned** | They won't be in your export | Drag all files to the tree |
| **Empty tree** | Nothing to export | Use "Add Sample" and "Add Reaction" |
| **No filtering** | Unwanted data in export | Use inclusion/exclusion controls |
| **No descriptions** | Lost context later | Add brief descriptions |
| **Skipping validation** | Errors when uploading | Review everything first |

## Advanced Tips

**Keep track of versions:**
- Name files with dates for checkpoints
- Include your initials in filenames
- Keep a simple changelog
- Back up your ZIPs to shared storage
