# Complete SmartAdd Workflow

This guide walks you through the entire workflow from uploading data to importing it into Chemotion.

## Step 1: Upload Data

### Upload Your Files

Upload your analytical data and related files to SmartAdd. The files will be stored in the input area, ready for you to organize into samples and reactions.

#### Option A: Upload Individual Files
1. Drag analytical files (spectra, MOL files, images, etc.) directly into the "Drag files here" area
2. Files are processed and appear in the input list view on the left
3. Files are ready to be assigned to samples and reactions

#### Option B: Upload a ZIP Archive
1. Prepare a ZIP file containing your analytical data and related files
2. Drag the ZIP file into the upload area
3. SmartAdd extracts all contents automatically
4. All files appear in the input list view

:::info[No Pre-Organization Required]
- ZIP files don't need to follow any specific folder structure
- SmartAdd extracts all files regardless of how they're organized
- You'll build the sample/reaction structure manually in the next steps
- Focus on using clear, descriptive filenames for easier assignment later
:::

### File Naming Tips

Use clear filenames to make assignment easier:
- ✅ Good: `compound_A_1H_NMR_400MHz.jdx`
- ✅ Good: `sample_001_structure.mol`
- ✅ Good: `data@#$_final_v2.txt`
- ✅ Good: `file1.jdx`

### Supported File Types

- **Spectra**: NMR data files
- **Structure Files**: MOL, text files
- **Images**: PNG, JPG
- **Text Files**: Metadata, notes, experimental details
- **Archives**: ZIP files containing any of the above

## Step 2: Create & Organize Structure

### Build Your Collection Manually

Now you'll create the structure by manually adding samples and reactions, then assigning your uploaded files to them.

### Understanding the Tree Hierarchy

SmartAdd uses this hierarchy (as shown in the right panel):

```
📦 Collection (Assignment Tree)
  ├─ 🧪 Reaction 1
  │   ├─ 📋 Sample 1 (Reactant)
  │   │   └─ 📊 Analyses
  │   │       └─ 📊 Analysis (e.g., NMR)
  │   │           └─ 📁 Datasets
  │   │               └─ 📄 Files
  │   └─ 📋 Sample 2 (Product)
  │       └─ 📊 Analyses
  └─ 📋 Sample 3 (Standalone)
      └─ 📊 Analyses
```

**Typical hierarchy:** Reactions → Samples → Analyses → Analysis → Datasets → Files

### How to Build Your Structure

There are multiple ways to build and organize your collection:

#### Method 1: Using Action Buttons
1. **Add Samples**: Click "Add Sample" button in the right panel
2. **Add Reactions**: Click "Add Reaction" button to create reaction nodes
3. **Assign Files**: Drag files from the input list (left) to samples/analyses in the tree (right)
4. **Edit Properties**: Click any node to edit its properties in the properties panel

#### Method 2: Using Quick Add Buttons
- **Plus Button Next to Reaction**: Click the `+` button next to any reaction node to quickly add samples to that reaction

#### Method 3: Using Context Menu (Right-Click)
Right-click on any node in the tree to open a context menu with options:
- **Edit Name**: Rename the selected item
- **Add Sample**: Add a sample (when right-clicking on reaction)
- **Add Analysis**: Add analysis to a sample
- **Add Dataset**: Add dataset to an analysis
- **Delete**: Remove the selected item and its children

:::tip[Multiple Ways to Work]
Choose the method that feels most natural to you! The context menu (right-click) is especially useful for quickly adding nested items without navigating through menus.
