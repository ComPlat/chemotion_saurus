ChemLocalLink is a cross-platform desktop-based software, designed to handle opening all ELN files locally, keeping them in one place for easier editing, opening, and uploading them back if needed.  
It is essentially a one-click-to-edit tool -> click on the link, open with desktop app, edit and upload again.

**Key Features:**
- **URL Handling**: Handles chemotion-specific URLs to react with Chemotion.
- **History**: Maintains a list of downloaded Files for easy access and management.
- **File Handling**: Allows users to download Chemotion-related files, modify them, and then upload back
- **Notifications**: Integrated system tray and app window notifications to alert users about the status of their tasks.
