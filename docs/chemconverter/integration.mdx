# ELN integration

The Chemotion Converter is integrated as a background process, so the normal user will not notice it.
If using a file from your inbox coming from an integrated device, you should use the already ChemConverted file among it (if a conversion is necessary / possible for this kind of file).
To do so, just drag & drop it from the inbox to the wanted field of the ELN GUI.
The exact workflow is shown in the animated picture.
