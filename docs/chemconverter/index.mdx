# Overview of the Converter functions

The purpose of the Chemotion Converter (in short: ChemConverter) is to convert different file formats and types from [integrated devices](/docs/eln/devices) to a common and well known data type, namely e.g. jcamp .jdx or .json.
It is also possible to extract columns for 2D data visualization and Metadata.
Currently, the ChemConverter can handle most text readable files like txt/csv/dta if they are properly structured, but developers can create their own readers if a rule is notable for the newly added file type.

Most of the time, the ChemConverter runs as a background process when the user or a measurement device uploads a analytic file to the ELN.
The prerequisite is that an admin has created a suitable [profile](#create-your-own-profile).
There is also a standalone version of the converter which you can find and install from [Github](https://github.com/jochenklar/chemotion-converter-app).

## Technical aspect

Technically the converter is built based on three layers, namely the reader, the admin GUI and last but not least the upload & processing.
The creator of reader requires mostly knowledge in (e.g python) coding while the admin of the second layer has to know the measurement technique and device very well, because it decides which info the use will get and see at the end of the third layer.
The last layer is a simple Webapp executing the code or an automated process during the file upload.
How the files are converted will be decided by specific rules which are listening on predefined identifiers.

### First layer: The reader

The reader is one part of programming code responsible for the software to import and handle the given data format.
It is the most powerfull layer due to flexibility (e.g. calculation of custom Metadata or special and complex column rules and calculations).

Source codes for the readers and examples can also be found on [Github](https://github.com/jochenklar/chemotion-converter-app/tree/master/converter_app/readers).
There are readers for common file types and specific ones which are heirs of the basic ones.
The following list shows some (but not all) of the current readers available:

- ASCII (aka simple TXT)
- CSV
  - NOVA (Specific reader for an instrument without Metadata, also an example for custom Metadata calculation)
- DTA

### Second layer: The admin Profile creation GUI

The final rules to convert a data file into a standardized Bagit-it-zip-Container containing .jdx/.json files will be determined by profiles.
Which profile is responsible is determined via identifiers.
Like in case of the readers almost everything the input file contains can be used as an identifier, as long as the sum of identifiers for one profile is unique.
The most common identifiers are:

- The file extension (.txt, .csv, .dta, ...)
- The first human readable line(s) of the header
- The data column titles

#### Purpose of the Profile GUI vs. Reader coding

The aim of the profiles is to give admin users, which are less or non-experience with Python Coding, the possibility to define rule sets for conversion.
It's also possible to define different profiles using the same Reader but slightly different data files (e.g., if only one column is varying or two columns are mixed).

### Third layer: Upload, processing and output

The normal user will only see the upload GUI, shown by the picture as standalone version (left) or inside the ELN (right).

After the file is uploaded, it will be converted as long as there exists a suitable reader and profile.
It's possible (via deep coding) to define which file types are redirected to the converter and which ones are only displayed as they are (e.g. in case of binary files like pictures) to evade errors from the Converter app.

## How-to ...

The following section is important for privileged users and admins to help them doing their own adjustments and profiles.

### ... find all current existing profiles

If using the standalone version just write your "converter-URL"/admin/ into your browser's address bar.
And if you are using the ELN integrated version you have to be logged in as an admin and click on the "Converter Profiles"-Tab on the left side.
In both cases you will see the following GUI where all your profiles are listed (if there are already some of course):

After clicking on the "Create new new profile"-Button you can finally start to ...

### ... create your own profile

To create a profile a first example file has to be uploaded.
This file should be a maxima example with as much information as possible, even if later data files sometimes have fewer.
The file type and it contents must fit to an existing reader or an error will occur.
After the upload, the following default GUI will be shown:

![Default screen after upload a file for profile creation - Screen 1](/img/converter/CreateProfileGUI_1.PNG)
![Default screen after upload a file for profile creation - Screen 2](/img/converter/CreateProfileGUI_2.PNG)

After all the adjustments and settings are done, the "Create profile" button will finish the job and the screen will be back to the existing profiles page.
Now a non-admin user or an automatic process can upload and convert files.

#### Specific settings

##### Data Class

The "Data Class" drop down menu defines the kind of jdx output.
Currently there are four used classes:

| Data Class | description                                                                                                                                  | requirements                                                                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| XY POINTS  | typical "modern data curves" where each data point is described by two coordinates (x and y). Difference between each x need not to be equal | exactly one column with x values & one column with y values                      |
| XY DATA    | Classical jcamp files with the intension to save hard drive space. Difference between each x is always equal.                                | exactly one column with y values and defined values for FIRSTX, LASTX and DELTAX |
| PEAK TABLE |                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                  |
| NTUBLES    |                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                  |
