## Troubleshooting

### I cannot create a profile on the admin GUI (Webserver does nothing or ERROR Message)

- <b>Answer:</b> There can be multiple reasons, but the most common are:

  - You are trying to upload a binary file (not supported yet!)
  - There's no reader (yet) for your specific data type and the standard reader don't work either.
  - You are in the wrong menu, please press the right button. <br/> <img src="/img/converter/dontImport.svg"

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Why using .jdx and not e.g. .csv for the converter output?

- <b>Answer:</b> There are mostly two reasons:

  1. Jcamp .jdx is well know and used among chemists and companies (like Bruker), belongs to the IUPAC and it's [standardized with multiple extensions.](https://doi.org/10.1366/0003702884428734).
  2. [CSV is it not!](https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC4180)

### What data formats are supported as input

- <b>Short answer:</b> Mostly all common non-binary files (txt, csv, dta ...) are at least with basic feature.
- <b>Long answer:</b> We encourage you to look at the [reader documentation page](readers). Here you will also find a list of readers with advanced features.

### I'm a (LabView, Simulink, Matlab ...) developer, coder or IT person. Are there any guidelines how to design the output files of my test stand / experiment / script?

- <b>Answer:</b> Of course there are and we are happy to help you against closed, unreadable and proprietary data! Therefore, a document with simple and basic guidelines (currently in beta status) was created.
