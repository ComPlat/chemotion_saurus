## Troubleshooting

### I cannot create a profile on the admin GUI (Webserver does nothing or ERROR Message)

- <b>Answer:</b> There can be multiple reasons, but the most common are:

  - You are trying to upload a binary file (not supported yet!)
  - There's no reader (yet) for your specific data type and the standard reader don't work either.
  - You are in the wrong menu, please press the right button. <br> <img src="/img/converter/dontImport.svg" alt="Please don't click import, create instead" style="width:600px;height:300px;">

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Why using .jdx and not e.g. .csv for the converter output?

- <b>Answer:</b> There are mostly two reasons:

  1. Jcamp .jdx is well know and used among chemists and companies (like Bruker), belongs to the IUPAC and it's [standardized with multiple extensions.](https://doi.org/10.1366/0003702884428734).
  2. [CSV is it not!](https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC4180)
