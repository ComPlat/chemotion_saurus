# Troubleshooting

### I cannot create a profile on the admin GUI (Webserver does nothing or ERROR Message)

There can be multiple reasons, but the most common are:
* You are trying to upload a binary file (not supported yet!)
* There's no reader (yet) for your specific data type and the standard reader don't work either.
* You are in the wrong menu, please press the right button. <br>  <img src="/img/converter/dontImport.svg" alt="Please don't click import, create instead" style="width:600px;height:300px;">

# Q&A

### Why using .jdx and not e.g. .csv for the converter output?

There are mostly two reasons:
1. Jcamp .jdx is well know and used among chemnists and companies (like Bruker), belongs to the IUPAC and it's [standardized with multiple extensions.](https://doi.org/10.1366/0003702884428734)
2. [CSV is it not!](https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC4180)
