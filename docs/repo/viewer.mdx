The 3D Viewer function integrates the [Jmol/JSmol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jmol) library to provide users with the capability to visualize chemical structures in three dimensions. This function offers an interactive and detailed exploration of molecular structures, allowing users to rotate, zoom, and adjust the 3D representations for a comprehensive understanding of the molecule's geometry and properties.

The function supports viewing various file formats, including CIF, MOL, SDF, PDB, and MOL2, enabling users to display structures with information.
