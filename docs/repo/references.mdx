References can be added by any registered user. To avoid misleading links to the data and to be as transparent as possible, the user who added the reference to a submission is given as information.  
References can be either literature that is related to the given molecule and a reaction or it can be literature that gives the description of exactly the sample that is described.  
Scheme only contributions are often added by scientists that are not the authors of the original work where the reaction was mentioned. Therefore, scheme only reactions should be given along with the publication that describes the reaction - if possible <!--truncate-->and available. If you are the author of a scheme only publication, please add the reference to your publication as soon as it is available.
