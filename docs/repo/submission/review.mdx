The reviewing of all data will be done after your submission (independent of setting an embargo). The submitted data is only visible and accessible to selected members of the Chemotion repository group who will handle your data as confidential information.

Your data is checked for formal issues (formatting, purity of the compounds and quality of the spectra) and for plausibility. The plausibility check is supported by automated procedures. After the Chemotion team checked your data, you will receive a reviewing protocol including the necessary changes if there are any. You will receive a notification in the repository UI and an email will be sent to your contact email address. Please open the given links or open the reviewing protocol in the repository “My DB” area, collection: “reviewing”.
