The repository can be used to disclose data assigned to molecules (samples) or reactions and their products. The easiest way to enter data to the repository is to

- either transfer already available datasets and information from the Chemotion ELN to the repository
- or, if you are not using the ELN, you can add the data via upload of files.

In both cases, your data is available via your personal account and is not visible to others. The disclosure of stored or uploaded data is done in a second step (described in [submitting data](workflow/submit)) and requires your submission.

For any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.
