The Chemotion Repository exposes a set of **public, REST-style endpoints** that let external applications retrieve rich metadata programmatically. These endpoints are designed to facilitate interoperability, support automated data harvesting, and integrate seamlessly with external platforms such as ELNs, repositories, or data analysis tools.

All endpoints are reachable without authentication, making integration straightforward.
