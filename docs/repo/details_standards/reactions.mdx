## General aspects

Please ensure that the description of the reaction is as comprehensive as possible. The description of the reaction needs to be understandable and reproducible including all details of a reaction. Common practices - as accepted by some journals - such as giving only one general description used for different reactions are not matching the needs of the repository. Please give a distinct description including the name and amount of the reagents that were used.

- Please ensure that no abbreviations are used that need further explanations. If you need to add abbreviations, please define them in "additional information for publication and purification". For common abbreviations, please see section ["Abbreviations and names"](#abbreviations-and-names)
- Please use the exact name of the given reagents instead of general terms such as "the amine", "the aldehyde", the "starting material"
- Please add the distinct temperature instead of RT/rt/room temperature, if not otherwise possible, please add the temperature as a range such as "21-25 °C"
- Please add the duration of a reaction as precisely as possible and avoid "overnight"
- Please ensure that no labels from a journals publication are included (e.g. information such as compound No **233c** should be removed)
- Please describe the product obtained with color and physical state, please take care: solids or liquids are usually not white -> they are colorless
- The description of the reaction should end with a sentence that includes the name of the isolated/gained compound and its amount in mg/g, mmol/mol and %. E.g. "After purification, 1-naphthyl-{1-[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl]indol-3-yl}methanone (62.3 mg, 145 μmol) was obtained in 27% yield as a colorless solid". The name can be omitted and replaced by "the target compound" or "the product" if the name can only be hardly accessed or is very long.

## Molecules and their details

Please give all necessary details of the molecules/samples used in the reaction, this includes with respect to the sample (please change in the sample):
- information on the stereochemistry of chiral molecules. If the compound is racemic, please add this information in the field for abs stereoinformation
- information on the melting point for products that are obtained as solid material

#### Chemicals used with less than 100% purity or added as mixture, solution or others

Usually, reactions in Chemotion repository are generated in the reaction mode and chemicals are used as they were defined in the sample. For adaptations which might be required due to a lower purity of the sample or the use of a solution that contains the sample, please open the sample and change the value in the sample edit mode. Typical examples are: <br/>
Use of Pd/C (10%) -> please change the purity of the sample Pd from 1.0 to 0.1.<br/>
Use of an impure reagent (90% purity) -> please change the purity of the reagent from 1.0 to 0.9.<br/>
Use of 1 M reagent -> please set the molarity of the reagent in the sample to 1 M. <br/>
The reaction table in the repository changes the values according to the added purities, molarities. 

#### Giving the amount of solvents/chemicals 
Valid options are:  
(a) 100 mL of ethyl acetate, 
(b) ethyl acetate (100 mL) was added

#### Giving the amount of chemicals used as reagent or reactant 
Valid options are:  
(a) quinoline-4-carboxylic acid (20.0 g, 115 mmol, 1.00 equiv), 
(b) …20.0 g of quinoline-4-carboxylic acid (115 mmol, 1.00 equiv)

#### Giving the amount of chemicals as a product of a reaction 
Valid options are: 
(a) Methyl quinoline-4-carboxylate (16.4 g, 87.5 mmol, 76% yield) was isolated as a colorless solid.
(b) Methyl quinoline-4-carboxylate (16.4 g, 87.5 mmol) was isolated as a colorless solid in 76% yield.
(c) Methyl quinoline-4-carboxylate was isolated as a colorless solid in 76% yield (16.4 g, 87.5 mmol).


## Units

Please adjust the space between numbers and units according to common standards:  
All combinations of number and unit should be given with space, only the combination number+% (e.g. yield or concentration) are given without.

- 12 h (wrong: 12h), 12 min (wrong: 12min), 12 °C (not 12°C), 12 mM (wrong: 12mM)
- But: the product was obtained in 12% yield or 5% methanol in water

## Abbreviations and names

Many solvents and others are commonly given with abbreviations. Please see the following list of abbreviations that should be used. Please do not use others.

- THF: tetrahydrofuran
- DMF: dimethylformamide
- EtOAc: ethyl acetate
- cHex: cyclohexane
- nHex: n-hexane
- DCM: methylene chloride
- MeOH: methanol
- DMSO: dimehtylsulfoxide
