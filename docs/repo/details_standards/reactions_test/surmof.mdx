:::note[Information]

Please read the guidelines that are given on the top level page [reactions](/index.mdx) . The basic concepts described there need to be applied for MOF reactions as well.

:::

Chemotion repository requires the addition of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) in a standardized manner. To describe the synthesis of metal organic frameworks in an adequate manner, please consider the following sections **"MOF samples"**, **"MOF synthesis"**, **"SURMOF synthesis"** at this page and refer to characterization standards on [Analyses](../analysis_test) .

### MOF samples

### SURMOF samples

#### Drawing

SURMOF samples consist of a representative unit of the MOF structure and a linkage to the surface.

:::note[Ketcher rails needed]

For a SURMOF drawing, please use ketcher-rails as a molecule editor. Other molecule editors than ketcher rails lack the necessary function to add surfaces to the drawing.

:::

- please select the surface symbol to represent the surface
- add one or multiple surface-symbols to describe the surmof
- use the bracket symbol to assign the composition of the surface as provided
- include layers that were provided as preparation of the surface. Only those molecules/atoms that are part of the reaction scheme are added to the surface as explicit molecules.
- ensure that metal organic bonds are represented as coordinative bonds and that the corresponding fragments are given as ionic components
