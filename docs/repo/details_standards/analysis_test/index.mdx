:::caution Important information for this page
This page contains a collection of ideas to give inline notations for analytical data in the future. We provide this page to discuss options for a clear formatting of descriptions - but there is no need to adapt to the given rules at the moment. This is a test area.

## Order of analyses

Please order the analysis part of your molecules/samples according to:

1. <sup>1</sup>H NMR,
2. <sup>13</sup>C NMR,
3. Other [NMR](analysis_test/nmr) data,
4. [Mass Spectroscopy](analysis_test/ms) data,
5. IR data, and
6. Others (EA, crystal structures)
   For collecting data in the ELN/repository, please use the "order mode" button in the analysis tab. For inline notation, please add one technique after the other, separated by ".".

If detailed peak assignments are made, the type of NOESY or COSY methods used to establish atom connectivities and spatial <br />relationships should be identified in the Supporting Information.
