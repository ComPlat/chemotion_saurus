Metadata: Measurement type (fix = XRD), source that is used (e.g. Cu Kα, needs to come from user input in layout), general information on the data recorded/plotting (fix = 2θ [°] (d [nm])).
Therefore, the inline notation should look like:

XRD (Cu Kα1, 0.15406 nm, xxx °C), 2θ [°] (d [nm]): 5.2 (1.68), 10.1 (0.83)
