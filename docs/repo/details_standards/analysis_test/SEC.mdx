Size exclusion chromatography (SEC)

## Inline notation for thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) 

The inline notation gives a short summary of the metadata and a list of the results of the SEC measurement.
The notation of measurement should at least include the solvent, calibration, average molecular weight and dispersity of the measured sample.

SEC (THF, PMMA): Mn = 20.000 g/mol, Mw = 25.000 g/mol, (ggf Mv = 22.000 g/mol), D = 1.21.
SEC (solvent, standard): Mn = 20.000 g/mol, Mw = 25.000 g/mol, (ggf Mv = 22.000 g/mol), D = 1.21.

**Explanation:**<br /> 
Metadata<br /> 
solvent = mobile phase of the SEC instrument
standard = polymer standard used for the calibration of the instrument and analyzing the measured sample
Mn = number average molecular weight
Mw = weight average molecular weight
Mv = viscosity average molecular weight
D = dispersity of the molecular weight; D = Mw/Mn
