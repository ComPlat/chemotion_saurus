:::info[Important information for this page]

This page contains a collection of information how to reference analytical data. We provide this page to describe the preferred formatting of analytical evaluations in the Chemotion repository. The given preferences follow standards of journals/publishers and other stakeholders wherever we could find them. Currently, in particular the format of the metadata of the analytical data (everything before "=") is not reviewed critically. If you have suggestions and comments: please let us know or provide your ideas via the issue tracking option.

## Mass spectrometry data

1. Please give mass spectra in the form of the following examples. Important conventions are the listing of signals with their intensity (in round brackets) and the assignment of fragments to the corresponding sum formula [in squared brackets].

EI-MS

- MS (EI, 70 eV, 70 °C): m/z (%) = 278 (72) [M]<sup>+</sup>, 221 (100), 147 (31), 115 (15), 103 (23); HRMS–EI (m/z): [M]<sup>+</sup> calcd for C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>18</sub>OS<sub>2</sub>, 278.0794; found, 278.0795.
- MS (EI, 70 eV, 70 °C): m/z (%) = 278/280 (72/72) [M]<sup>+</sup>, 221/223 (100/100), 103 (23).

ESI-MS

Please mention the mode as well as the solvent used.
- MS (ESI+, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) m/z (%) : 337 (53) [M+Na]<sup>+</sup>, 305 (60) [M+H]<sup>+</sup>, 290 (11), 282 (16), 275 (17), 274 (100), 230 (10), 165 (10), 150 (12), 130 (34), 120 (10). HRMS (ESI+, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) m/z (%) calcd for C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>21</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sup>+</sup> 305.1648, found 305.1644.
- MS (ESI-, MeCN) m/z (%) : 162 (40) [M-H]<sup>-</sup>, 140 (22), 119 (100), 56 (38).



2. Please ensure that the peak with the highest detected molecular mass belongs to your molecule (either as fragment if the molecule peak is not found, or as part of a formed complex/dimer or similar). If there are signals with a higher mass than your product, please explain these masses and give this explanation after the signal in the signal list. Please indicate additional signals in the form of either:
- Impurities: <i>explanation</i>
- Reference: <i>explanation</i>

3. Please group the peaks according to signals that refer to one molecule fragment (all peaks belonging to an isotopic pattern form one signal group). Please start the listing of signals with the highest detected mass and finish with the lowest.
4. Within one signal, please list the peaks from low to high m/z.
5. Please give isotope patterns for Cl- and Br-containing compounds
6. Please remove naturally occurring isotopes.
7. HRMS

Examples for Organic chemistry

  In case [M]<sup>+</sup> is given, please make sure to calculate the theoretical mass for the cationic species, i.e. [M-e<sup>-</sup>]<sup>+</sup>.
- HRMS (ESI-TOF, MeCN): m/z = calcd for C<sub>13</sub>H<sub>17</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>Na [M+Na]<sup>+</sup> 258.1106; found 258.1104.
- HRMS (FAB, matrix NBA): m/z = calcd for C<sub>13</sub>H<sub>18</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> [M+H]<sup>+</sup>: 236.1287; found: 236.1290.
- HRMS (ESI+, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>): m/z =  calcd for C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>31</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [M+H]<sup>+</sup>: 391.2380; found 391.2377.
- HRMS (ESI-, MeCN): m/z =  calcd for C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub> [M-H]<sup>-</sup>: 163.0401; found 163.0404.

Examples for Inorganic chemistry
- HRMS (ESI+, MeCN): m/z (%) = 663.24608 (100), 664.24910 (37), 665.24508 (48), 666.24762 (17), 667.25040 (3). m/z (calc) = 663.24630 [12C321H4063Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (100), 664.24966 [12C3113C1H4063Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (35), 665.24449 [12C321H4065Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (45), 666.24785 [12C3113C1H4065Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (15), 667.25120 [12C3013C21H4065Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (3).
