:::caution Important information for this page
This page contains a collection of ideas to give inline notations for analytical data in the future. We provide this page to discuss options for a clear formatting of descriptions - but there is no need to adapt to the given rules at the moment. This is a test area. Nevertheless: if you have suggestions and comments: please let us know or provide your ideas via the issue tracking option.

## Mass spectrometry data **extension**

1. Please give mass spectra in the form of the following examples. Important conventions are the listing of signals with their intensity (in round brackets) and the assignment of fragments to the corresponding sum formula [in squared brackets].

- MS (EI, 70 eV, 70 °C): m/z (%) = 278 (72) [M]<sup>+</sup>, 221 (100), 147 (31), 115 (15), 103 (23); HRMS–EI (m/z): [M]<sup>+</sup> calcd for C15H18OS2, 278.0794; found, 278.0795.
- MS (EI, 70 eV, 70 °C): m/z (%) = 278/280 (72/72) [M]<sup>+</sup>, 221/223 (100/100), 103 (23).
- HRMS (ESI+, MeCN): m/z (%) = 663.24608 (100), 664.24910 (37), 665.24508 (48), 666.24762 (17), 667.25040 (3). m/z (calc) = 663.24630 [12C321H4063Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (100), 664.24966 [12C3113C1H4063Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (35), 665.24449 [12C321H4065Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (45), 666.24785 [12C3113C1H4065Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (15), 667.25120 [12C3013C21H4065Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (3).

2. Please ensure that the peak with the highest detected molecular mass belongs to your molecule (either as fragment if the molecule peak is not found, or as part of a formed complex/dimer or similar). If there are signals with a higher mass than your product, please explain these masses and give this explanation after the signal in the signal list. Please indicate additional signals in the form of either: 
- Impurities: <i>explanation</i>
- Reference: <i>explanation</i>
3. Please group the peaks according to signals that refer to one molecule fragment (all peaks belonging to an isotopic pattern form one signal group). Please start the listing of signals with the highest detected mass and finish with the lowest. 
4. Within one signal, please list the peaks from low to high m/z.  
5. Please give isotope patterns for Cl- and Br-containing compounds
