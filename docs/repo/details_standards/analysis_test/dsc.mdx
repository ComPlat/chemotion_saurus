## Inline notation for TGA thermal gravimetric analysis (DSC) 

The inline notation gives a short summary of the metadata and a list of the results of the DSC measurement. 
The analysis of the DSC measurements should report values from all segments. To be reported are the glass transition temperature (Tg) (maximum/minimum of first derivative), the melting temperature (Tm) (maximum/minimum of first derivative) inlcuding the melting enthalpy (area under the curve for the melting peak). System peaks need to be omitted (by cutting the analysis temperature by  ~20 °C on every side)

### Examples for desired formatting:

**Standard example:** <br /> 
DSC (150 to -150, 10 °C/min): Temp. in °C (heat flow in mW/mg, Tx, Seg) = 50 (T<sub>g</sub>, S2), 100 (area, T<sub>m</sub>, S2), 55 (T<sub>g</sub>, S4), 102 (area, T<sub>m</sub>, S4). <br />
