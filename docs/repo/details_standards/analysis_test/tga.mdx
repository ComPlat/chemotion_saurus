## Inline notation for thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) 

The inline notation gives a short summary of the metadata and a list of the results of the TGA measurement. 
The analysis of the TGA measurements should contain at least the values for T<sub>5%</sub> (Temperature at which 5% are decomposed), T<sub>95%</sub> (Temperature at which 95% are decomposed), and T<sub>max</sub> (Temperature with the highest decomposition, maximum of first derivative). The latter one should be labelled with "*". Additional decompositions steps should be included if detected and listed between T<sub>5%</sub> and T<sub>95%</sub>. If there are known decomposition reasons (such as loss of water) this information should be added in brackets after the listing of the corresponding air of temperature/%.

### Examples for desired formatting:

**Standard example:**<br /> 
TGA (Pt; N<sub>2</sub>; 30 °C (3 min), 30 °C to 900 °C (10 °C/min), 900 °C): Temp. in °C (weight loss, %) = 50 (5), 80* (30) [-EtOH], …., 100 (95) [-H<sub>2</sub>O]. <br />

Original text for the process -> summarized in the example above: <br />
Select Gas: Gas 1 ; Equilibrate 30,00 °C; Isothermal 3,0 min; Ramp 10,00 °C/min to 900,00 °C; Equilibrate 900,00 °C; Select Gas: Gas 2 ; Isothermal 10,0 min
