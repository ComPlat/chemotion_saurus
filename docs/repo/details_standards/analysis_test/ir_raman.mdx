## IR spectroscopy data

:::info Important information for this page

This page contains a collection of ideas to give inline notations for analytical data in the future. We provide this page to discuss options for a clear formatting of descriptions - but there is no need to adapt to the given rules at the moment. This is a test area. Nevertheless: if you have suggestions and comments: please let us know or provide your ideas via the issue tracking option.

Important IR absorptions should be included in the experimental details section.

Please give the IR spectra analysis in the following form:

- IR (ATR): ṽ [cm<sup>-1</sup>] = 2895, 1703, 1598, 1488, 1438, 1417, 1359, 1279, 1240, 1157, 1113, 1072, 1023, 998, 962, 910, 818, 786, 759, 699, 653, 616.
