This page contains a collection of information how to reference analytical data. We provide this page to describe the preferred formatting of analytical evaluations in the Chemotion repository. The given preferences follow standards of journals/publishers and other stakeholders wherever we could find them. Currently, the in particular the format of the metadata of the analytical data (everything before "=") is not reviewed critically.

**General description of CV measurement routines**

1. measurement of a blank (solvent with electrolyte) sample (facultative)
2. the analyte is added and measured 
3. Fc or other (e.g. Me<sub>10</sub>Fc) reference is added and measured.

Hint: Polish the working electrode (glassy carbon or others e.g. platinum) and degas (with solvent saturated Ar, at least 5 min, or N2) between the runs.

**Shifting Potentials**

Because the measured potentials are strongly dependent on the reference electrode, it's important to shift your potentials and report them against a well-known reference.
The following references are recommended:
1. Ferrocene and setting the Fc<sup>+</sup>/Fc couple to 0 V
2. SCE and setting the Fc<sup>+</sup>/Fc couple to 0.38 V (value for Fc in MeCN) 

**Inline notation**

CV (1 mM in MeCN vs. Ref (Fc<sup>+</sup>/Fc) = 0 V, ν = 0.1 V/s, to neg.): E<sub>1/2</sub> ([Cu(TMGqu)2]<sup>2+</sup>/[Cu(TMGqu)2]<sup>+</sup>, ΔE<sub>p</sub>) = −0.44 V (90 mV)
