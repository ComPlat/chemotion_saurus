CV (1 mM in MeCN vs. RefE = Ag/AgNO<sub>3</sub> (0.01 M AgNO<sub>3</sub>, 0.1 M TBAP in MeCN), 1 mM Fc, 100 mV/s): E1/2 (ΔE<sub>p</sub>) = −0.373 V (85 mV) [[Cu(TMGqu)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+/+</sup>], +0.060 V (80 mV) [Fc<sup>+</sup>/Fc].

CV (1 mM in MeCN vs. Fc<sup>+</sup>/Fc, 100 mV/s): E<sub>1/2</sub>,ref (ΔEp) = −0.433 V (85 mV), [[Cu(TMGqu)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+/+</sup>]. The measurement started in the direction of negative potentials.
