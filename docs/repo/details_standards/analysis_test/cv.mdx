This page contains a collection of information how to reference analytical data. We provide this page to describe the preferred formatting of analytical evaluations in the Chemotion repository. The given preferences follow standards of journals/publishers and other stakeholders wherever we could find them. Currently, the in particular the format of the metadata of the analytical data (everything before "=") is not reviewed critically.

**General description of CV measurement routines**

(1) measurement of a blank (solvent with electrolyte) sample (facultative)
(2) the analyte is added and measured 
(3) Fc or other reference is added and measured.
Hint: Polish the working electrode (glassy carbon or others e.g. platinum) and degas (with solvent saturated Ar, at least 5 min, or N2) between the runs. 

**Inline notation**

CV (1 mM in MeCN vs. RefE = Ag/AgNO<sub>3</sub> (0.01 M AgNO<sub>3</sub>, 0.1 M TBAP in MeCN), 1 mM Fc, 100 mV/s): E1/2 (ΔE<sub>p</sub>) = −0.373 V (85 mV) [[Cu(TMGqu)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+/+</sup>], +0.060 V (80 mV) [Fc<sup>+</sup>/Fc].

CV (1 mM in MeCN vs. Fc<sup>+</sup>/Fc, 100 mV/s): E<sub>1/2</sub>,ref (ΔEp) = −0.433 V (85 mV), [[Cu(TMGqu)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+/+</sup>]. The measurement started in the direction of negative potentials.
