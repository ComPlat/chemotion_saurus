Example for analysis of quantitative UV-Vis: 
UV-VIS (abs, CH<sub>3</sub>OH, 10 mM, 20 °C); λmax [nm] (log ε, M<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup>) = xxx (a.aa)[sh], yyy (b.bb)[sh].

UV-VIS (abs, CH<sub>3</sub>OH, 10 mM, 20 °C); λmax [nm] (log ε, M<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup>) = xxx [sh], yyy [sh].

xxx, yyy -> λmax in nm
(a.aa),(b.bb) -> log ε in M<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup>
[sh] -> details if there are any, e.g. assignment
