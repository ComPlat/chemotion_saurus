# Synthesis

can be of type: microwave, solvothermal, heating/stirring, mechanochemical, sonochemical 

## general description 
type: text
description: the general description depends on the type of synthesis. It explains how the information on how the single steps of preparation, conduction and workup are combined.  

## preparation
### preparation of mixtures
### preparation of vessels

## conduction

### device (as defined as entity, link)
### vessel (as defined as entity, link)
### reaction volume
type: 
description: 
### reaction parameters
description: the reaction parameters depend on the type of MOF production, e.g. for microwave reactions, the programmed reaction parameters should be given
### environment parameters
#### humidity
### reaction atmosphere
can be of type: ambient (air), protective nitrogen, protective argon, other

### comments and further details
type: text

## work-up
