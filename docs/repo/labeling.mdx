Labeling enables easy identification and differentiation of various samples. Labels associated with samples aid in data management and analysis. Clear labeling within a system promotes collaboration among you and your collaborators by providing a standardized way to reference and share samples. You can create and manage labeling options in the **My Labels**. This page provides an overview of the different types of labeling options and how to create and manage them.

## Types of Labels

There are three types of labels:
- **Private**: Exclusive access for you.
- **Public**: Shareable before publication, Visible to all users.
- **Global**: Open to everyone.

### Private Labels

Private labels are only visible to you. You can use Private Labels to organize and manage your samples in a way that is meaningful to you.

### Public Labels

Public labels are visible to all users. You can associate samples with Public Labels before publication and share them with collaborators.

### Global Labels

Global labels are open to everyone. You can use Global labels to standardize the labeling of samples across the entire system. Only authorized users can create and edit Global labels.

Chemotion Repository provides a global label called <span style={{display: 'inline-block', padding: '.2em .6em .4em', fontSize: '75%', fontWeight: '700', lineHeight: '1', color: '#fff', textAlign: 'center', whiteSpace: 'nowrap', verticalAlign: 'middle', borderRadius: '10px', backgroundColor: 'purple'}}>Commercial</span> to define the compounds obtained from suppliers for the purpose of analyzing derivatives.

## Use Labels

You can assign labels to samples to help you organize and manage your samples. The labels display on the sample list and the header of sample details.

:::tip

With different types of labels, you can easily establish a standard method for referencing and sharing your samples among yourself and your collaborators, or manage your samples using your own private labels.

1. Go to sample list. You can see the labels of each sample. In the below example, the labels like `MOF-SE` and `MOF-XRD` are displayed for you on the sample list.

<p align="center">
  <img src={sampleListLabels} alt="My Labels" />
  <FigCaption text="Labels are displayed on Sample list" />
</p>

2. Select a sample from sample list. You can also see the labels are displayed on the header.

<p align="center">
  <img src={sampleDetailLabels} alt="My Labels" />
  <FigCaption text="Labels are displayed on the sample detail header" />
</p>

3. Go to the **Properties** of sample detail page. Scroll down to locate the **My Labels**. Select the label from the list to assign a label to the sample. You can also click **x** to remove the label. Click **Save** to finish.
