Labeling enables easy identification and differentiation of various samples. Labels associated with samples aid in data management and analysis. Clear labeling within a system promotes collaboration among you and your collaborators by providing a standardized way to reference and share samples. You can create and manage labeling options in the **My Labels**. This page provides an overview of the different types of labeling options and how to create and manage them.

## Types of Labels

There are four types of labels:

- **Private**: Exclusive access for you.
- **Public**: Shareable before publication, Visible to all users.
- **Review**: For use by reviewers.
- **Global**: Open to everyone.

### Private Labels

Private labels are only visible to you. You can use Private Labels to organize and manage your samples in a way that is meaningful to you.

### Public Labels

Public labels are visible to all users. You can associate samples with Public Labels before publication and share them with collaborators.

### Review Labels

Review labels are for use by reviewers. This label is designed to mark submissions that need to be highlighted for reviewers, ensuring that critical items are easily identifiable.

### Global Labels

Global labels are open to everyone. You can use Global labels to standardize the labeling of samples across the entire system. Only authorized users can create and edit Global labels.

Chemotion Repository provides a global label called <span style={{display: 'inline-block', padding: '.2em .6em .4em', fontSize: '75%', fontWeight: '700', lineHeight: '1', color: '#fff', textAlign: 'center', whiteSpace: 'nowrap', verticalAlign: 'middle', borderRadius: '10px', backgroundColor: 'purple'}}>Commercial</span> to define the compounds obtained from suppliers for the purpose of analyzing derivatives.
