On this page we collect diagrams that provide some insight into the architecture of the ELN.
The collection is work-in-progress and by no means exhaustive.
However, we feel that even a few examples can be helpful for understanding the application, especially for onboarding developers.
There are no formal definitions regarding the scope and syntax of the diagrams (as would be the case for e.g., [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)).
Feel free to contribute any diagram that you find useful in working with, and understanding, the ELN.
