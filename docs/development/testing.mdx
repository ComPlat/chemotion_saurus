We test the Chemotion ELN using three different kinds of tests.

## 1. JavaScript unit tests (mocha)

```bash
npm test
```

## 2. Ruby unit tests (RSpec)

```bash
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:test:prepare && bundle exec rspec --exclude-pattern spec/features/**/*_spec.rb
```

## 3. Acceptance (feature) tests (~~Cyapybara~~ Cypress)

### Introduction

Cypress_on_rails is a gem developed by ShakaCode, a software consulting firm. It is designed to help developers with their testing efforts by integrating the popular Cypress testing framework with Ruby on Rails applications. The gem provides a simple and efficient way to run Cypress tests in a Rails environment, allowing developers to write and execute end-to-end tests with ease.

For more details, please follow official documentation.

### Installation

The cypress_on_rails gem is a tool that allows you to use Cypress with your Ruby on Rails application. Here are the steps to install and use it:
Add this to your Gem file

```ruby
group :test, :development do
  gem 'cypress-on-rails', '~> 1.0'
end
```

It is considered to be a best practice to keep everything inside cypress folder just to make sure isolation and clean way to work with independent technologies. Move cypress.config.js file to the spec/cypress

### Usage

```ruby
yarn cypress open --config-file spec/cypress/cypress.config.js
# Alternatively use following command
yarn cypress open --project spec
```

To run all tests at once,use following command

```ruby
yarn cypress run --config-file spec/cypress/cypress.config.js
# or alternatively
yarn cypress run --project spec
```

### Write First Test

As a first step, follow this link to start write your first end 2 end test.
<https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test>

### Example of using factory bot

It is always a good idea to create testing states programmatically, so further tests, can be written on top of it. In this regard, factory bots can save you a lot of time.
To demonstrate this, we are using the concept of factory bots as they are defined natively in the project in ~app/specs/features folder. From there, we can directly use them as they are defined or customize their attributes values as per requirements.
The example below will simply create a new user in the database, and is ready to be sign in with provided credentials.

```javascript
describe('create user', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.appFactories([
        ['create', 'user', {
         first_name: 'User',
         last_name: 'Complat',
         password: 'user_password',
         password_confirmation: 'user_password',
         email: 'cu1@complat.edu',
         name_abbreviation: 'cu1',
         account_active: 'true',
        }],
    cy.visit('users/sign_in');
  });
```

### Commands in Support Folder

There are many cases where you need to repeat chunk of code. In that case, it is better to use Commands. Commands is a concept, where you can call them whereever they are needed. It saves time and enhance clarity in the source code.
Move the code of creation of user inside spec/cypress/support/commands.js as shown below:

```javascript
Cypress.Commands.add('createDefaultUser', (emailAddress, abbr) => {
  cy.appFactories([
    ['create', 'user', {
      first_name: 'User',
      last_name: 'Complat',
      password: 'user_password',
      password_confirmation: 'user_password',
      email: emailAddress,
      name_abbreviation: abbr,
      account_active: 'true',
    }],
  ]);
});
```

Then your test will look like this. Notice, how your code became less more readable.

```javascript
describe('create user', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.createDefaultUser('cu1@complat.edu', 'cu1')
  });
```

### Example of user with collection

Here, we are creating a user with an empty collection in it. 'then' enables you to work with the yielded result from previous command.

```javascript
describe('create user', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.createDefaultUser('cu1@complat.edu', 'cu1').then((user) => {
      cy.appFactories([['create', 'collection', { user_id: user[0].id }]]);
    });
  });
```

### Example of creating a sample

In order to create a sample, one way is to create it by automating all the steps that are required by a user to perform in the browser. (Notice, the before block already include creation of user and collection).

```javascript
it('create samples', () => {
    cy.visit('users/sign_in');
    cy.get('#user_login').type('cu1');
    cy.get('#user_password').type('user_password');
    cy.get('div').find('[id="tree-id-Collection 1"]').click();
    cy.get('#create-split-button').click();
    cy.get('#create-sample-button').click();
    cy.get('.chem-identifiers-section > .list-group-item').click();
    cy.get('#smilesInput').type('c1cc(cc(c1)c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1');
    cy.get('#smile-create-molecule').click();
    cy.get('#submit-sample-btn').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/sample/1');
});
```

### Example of creating a sample state

```javascript
cy.createDefaultUser('cu1@complat.edu', 'cu1').then((user) => {
  cy.appFactories([['create', 'collection', { user_id: user[0].id }]]).then((collection) => {
    cy.appFactories([['create', 'molecule', { molecular_weight: 171.03448 }]]).then((molecule) => {
      cy.appFactories([['create', 'sample', {
        name: 'Material', target_amount_value: 7.15, molecule_id: molecule[0].id, collection_ids: collection[0].id
      }]]);
    });
  });
});
```

## General rules of thumb

- All public methods should be tested, every statement, conditional branch should be covered.
- Tests should be easy to read and understand. Try to use a maximum of 3 describe/context levels:
  - **Describe**: What is the class/method I want to test?
  - **Context**: Under what circumstances is the method tested?
  - **It**: What do I expect?
- Verifying UI state should not be the focus of unit testing (with the exception of snapshot testing in JavaScript).
- Useful resources
  - <https://mochajs.org/>
  - <https://www.betterspecs.org>
  - <https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara>
  - <https://rspec.info/>

### Javascript Unit tests

- Test files should be placed in **spec/javascript/...**, mirroring the location of the source file (i.e., the file under test).
- Test files should have the name of the file under test but end with **.spec.js**.
- For simple plain JavaScript objects, test every "public" method. Without access modifiers, look what methods are called by other components.

#### Testing React components

- Use the [Enzyme library](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) to create React components: `wrapper = shallow(<CLASS_OF_COMPONENT/>);`
- React components can be used with their JavaScript-state or their HTML representation: `wrapper.instance()` and `wrapper.html()`
- Example: [ResearchPlanDetailsFieldImage.spec.js](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/main/spec/javascripts/packs/src/apps/mydb/elements/details/researchPlans/ResearchPlanDetailsFieldImage.spec.js)

:::caution Important
When testing a component which includes a store you need to explicitly import he store in the test file. The import must be before the import statement of the component to test.
The linter recognizes that the store dependency is not used and tries to eliminate it. You can prevent this by manually disabling the linter rule for these lines.
Example: [ResearchPlanDetails.spec.js](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/main/spec/javascripts/packs/src/apps/mydb/elements/details/researchPlans/ResearchPlanDetails.spec.js)
:::

#### Stubbing/Mocking

- Heavy dependencies like REST calls can be [stubbed/mocked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) in a test
- We use the library sinon  
  `Sinon.stub(CLASS_TO_MOCK, "METHOD_NAME").callsFake(LAMBDA as replacement of original method);`
- Example: [ResearchPlanDetailsFieldImage.spec.js](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/main/spec/javascripts/packs/src/apps/mydb/elements/details/researchPlans/ResearchPlanDetailsFieldImage.spec.js#54)

#### Creating models with factories

- To create model objects, we use the library [factory-bot](https://github.com/ratson/factory-bot)
- `const researchPlan = await ResearchPlanFactory.build('empty');`
- By using a pseudoRandomGenerator in the factory for ids and checksums we can create reproducible objects
- One can reset the generator by adding a build option: `const researchPlan = await ResearchPlanFactory.build('empty', {}, { reset: true });`

:::caution Important
Creating a model is an asynchronous action, so the test must also be asynchronous: `it('no img tag should be rendered', async function (){ }`
:::

#### Snapshot testing

:::caution Deprecated chapter
Currently no snapshot testing is applied due to lack of capacity. In addition, ui testing will be covered by the system tests in the future.
:::

- When testing a React component, we want to verify the state of the component. An easy way to achieve this would be to check if its HTML state is as expected.
- By using the snapshot library [expect-mocha-snapshot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expect-mocha-snapshot), a snapshot of the HTML state is generated at the first test run. After that, the state in the test is checked against the saved state from the first run.
- Snapshots are saved in a folder **snapshots** at the same level of the test
- Snapshots are not only restricted to HTML but can also be used for JSON or JavaScript-objects
- Example: [ResearchPlanDetailsFieldImage.spec.js](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/applying-gem-shrine/spec/javascripts/packs/src/apps/mydb/elements/details/researchPlans/ResearchPlanDetailsFieldImage.spec.js#L52)

:::caution Important
The `expect` extension by mocha refers to the current test-object by `this`. Using an lambda expression at the it definition, mocha have no access to it. Using an explicit
function definition solves this problem.
:::

### Ruby Unit tests

#### Common infos

- Tests should reflect the structure of the source package. That means having the exact same location and name ending with `_spec.rb`.
- [Example test](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/development-5/spec/api/chemotion/attachment_api_spec.rb)

#### Creating database models with factory bot

- Models can be created using the library [factory bot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot). In factories, desired states of the models are predefined and can then be created using `create` (creates a DB entry) or `build` (creates a model without a DB entry).

:::caution IMPORTANT
Creating an attachment with factorybot must be handled carefully because `create` also triggers the `create_derivative` method and could remove a fixture file.
By using `build` the `create_derivative` method is not executed, but one has no object in the database and some properties are not initialized.
:::

#### Testing methods without classes

- can be done by adding type :helpers `Rspec.describe GenericHelpers, type: :helper do`.  
  Example [generic_helpers_spec.rb](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/applying-gem-shrine/spec/api/helpers/generic_helpers_spec.rb)

#### Stubbing/Mocking

- REST calls  
   `stub_request(REST_METHOD_AS_SYMBOL, 'REST_ADDRESS'`
  `.with(REQUEST_HEADER_INFOS OR/AND PARAMETER)`
  `.to_return(RETURN BODY OR/AND HEADER)`
  Example: [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/applying-gem-shrine/spec/spec_helper.rb#L86)

:::info Info
Many REST requests that request INCHI keys are already defined in [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/applying-gem-shrine/spec/spec_helper.rb#L86)
:::

- Methods of classes/objects  
  `allow_any_instance_of(CLASS_NAME).to receive(METHOD_NAME_AS_SYMBOL).and_return(RESULT)`  
  `allow_any_instance_of(CLASS_NAME).to receive(METHOD_NAME_AS_SYMBOL).and_raise(AN ERROR)`
- for more infos: [rspec-mocks](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/docs)

#### API - testing

- Tests for the api have to be in the subfolder spec/api/... to work properly

### Acceptance tests

When you have freshly installed Chemotion ELN, make sure to create a `welcome-message.md` file in the public directory inside Chemotion ELN before running acceptance tests. You can create it from the example file:

## Coverage

Infos about code coverage: [Code Coverage](https://www.guru99.com/code-coverage.html)

### JavaScript unit tests

- Using `npm run coverage` creates a coverage report in HTML written in .coverage. The method of covering is condition coverage.
- in package.json one can exclude directories from coverage
- Coverage is currently not included in CI

### Rspec unit tests

By running the rspec unit tests, the coverage is currently calculated automatically. The results can be found in the folder .coverage
