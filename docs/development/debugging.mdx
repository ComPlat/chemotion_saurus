## JavaScript

You can use your browser's developer tools:

## Ruby (Rails application)

Below are two options for "live"-debugging Ruby code (i.e., while the application is running).

### Pry

Install [`pry`](https://github.com/pry/pry) and set `binding.pry` breakpoints in your Ruby code:
<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/pry_debugging.html>. Pry should work independently of your IDE.

### Visual Studio Code

If you're using the Visual Studio Code IDE, you can use it's visual / GUI debugger.
The configuration depends on your local setup, however, following these instructions should get you started fine:

In case debugging doesn't work yet, have a look at the following resources to fine-tune your configuration:
