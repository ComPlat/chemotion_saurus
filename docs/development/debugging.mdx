## JavaScript

You can use your browser's [developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools).


## Ruby (Rails application)

Below are two options for "live"-debugging Ruby code (i.e., while the application is running).

### Pry

Install [`pry`](https://github.com/pry/pry) and set `binding.pry` breakpoints to [debug](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/pry_debugging.html) your Ruby code. Pry should work independently of your IDE.

### Visual Studio Code

If you're using the Visual Studio Code IDE, you can use it's visual / GUI debugger.
The configuration depends on your local setup, however, [these instructions](https://andyv.me/til/debug-a-ruby-on-rails-server-using-vs-code/) could help you get started.

In case debugging doesn't work yet, have a look at the following resources to fine-tune your configuration:

0. [Rubyide Debugger](https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/blob/main/docs/debugger.md)
0. [VSCode recipe for Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-recipes/blob/2174a750102a76142378ea08dbbb4a576dc6d1d5/debugging-Ruby-on-Rails/README.md)
