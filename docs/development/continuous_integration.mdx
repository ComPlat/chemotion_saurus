## GitHub Actions

We're running our CI with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), an automation tool by GitHub.
It automatically runs our test suite on pushes to the
[Chemotion ELN GitHub repository](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN).
For more information visit the official [GitHub documentation for Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

Our CI is configured in the following workflow file:
<https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/b59ab0d56b926c242d5e4d6bae869da10b2302ea/.github/workflows/ci.yml>.

## Docker

Because of large Ruby and npm dependencies, the CI is running inside a Docker container with prebuilt libraries
in order to speed up CI runs.
Our Docker image for CI is hosted at <https://hub.docker.com/r/complat/complat-ubuntu-runner>.
The CI image is built from the following Dockerfile:
<https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/b59ab0d56b926c242d5e4d6bae869da10b2302ea/Dockerfile.github-ci>.

We're using a PostgreSQL container to run the database alongside the ELN application:
<https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres>.

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions services can be down

If some GitHub services are not working, have a look at the [status page](https://www.githubstatus.com/).

### Flaky tests

Currently, the acceptance tests are flaky, meaning they fail in non-deterministic ways
because they are sensitive to timing (i.e., clicking on buttons that aren't rendered yet etc.).
