## 1. Supporting file formats

For NMR analysis, we are now only support [JCAMP-DX files](https://iupac.org/what-we-do/digital-standards/jcamp-dx/) (\*.jcamp, \*.dx, \*.jdx), zip (Bruker FID), Jeol (\*.jdf), NMRium (\*.nmrium) files.

## 2. Upload your data and view it

To upload and view your data, you can follow [this instruction](../chemspectra#2-analysing-data-in-chemotion-eln) or you can view the [demo video](../chemspectra/nmrium#6-demo-video)

## 3. Saving your analysed data

1. Save your analysed data by using `Close with Save` button

   <img
     src={
       require("@site/static/img/chemspectra/nmrium/nmrium_5.png").default
     }
     alt={"nmrium save"}
     height={"100%"}
     width={"100%"}
   />

## 4. How your data will be stored in ChemotionELN?

  When you click on `Close with Save` button, one `*.nmrium` file and one image file (a svg file) will be stored in ChemotionELN.
  In case of your **Chemspectra** service is available and **your data is 1D**, your analysed data will be stored in an `*.edit.jdx` file as well, that allow you can either open your analysed data with **Chemspectra** or **NMRium**.

## 5. Can I analyse data with Chemspectra and open it with NMRium?

  Yes. ChemotionELN supports synchronising data between Chemspectra and NMRium, in the case that both services are available.

## 6. Demo video

  <video controls height={"100%"} width={"100%"}>
