:::info
This page contains information on how to edit a page in the Docusaurus instance for the Chemotion ELN hosted at KIT.
The information also applies to editing other Docusaurus instances. In the latter case, replace special links, references etc. with the counterpart of your instance.
:::

This website is based on the [Docusaurus framework](https://docusaurus.io) using Markdown with JavaScript (MDX).
Therefore, the content is provided as Markdown containing elements from HTML and the JavaScript framework React.
The most important components are explained below. More information about Markdown in Docusaurus can be found in the [official Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

## Editing

To ensure consistent style and naming throughout the documentation, please make sure to have a look at our [style guide](documentation/style_guide).

### Contributors without write access to the `chemotion_saurus` GitHub repository

For changing the documentation you need a GitHub account.
[Sign up](https://github.com/signup) if you haven't got one already.
As a GitHub user you can edit Docusaurus pages directly on GitHub by clicking the
`Edit this page` button at the bottom left of every Docusaurus page (for example, scroll down to the bottom of the current page).

Clicking the `Edit this page` button takes you to an editor on GitHub where you can directly edit the page.
If you haven't edited any pages before (i.e., you're making your first contribution), GitHub will prompt you to "fork" the repository.
"Forking" means that you're making your own copy of the repository.
In order to fork the repository you only need to click the green `Fork this repository` button. Note that you need to fork only once, prior to your first contribution.

:::caution Important
It is important that you keep your fork in sync with the `chemotion_saurus` GitHub repository.
Every time you start editing, make sure to first sync your fork by [clicking the `Fetch upstream` button](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).
Without syncing, your fork might be out of date and you might be editing a page that someone else (or yourself) already edited in the past.
:::

Once you've forked the repository, editing pages works as follows.

Make your changes in the editor. The pages are written in Markdown. For more information on Markdown formatting
have a look at the [Markdown section](#markdown) on this page or [this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Once you're finished editing, scroll to the bottom of the editor page. There you can optionally provide a description of your changes.
If you do not provide a description, GitHub will add a default description for you.
By clicking the `Propose changes` button, you'll be taken to a page that summarizes your changes.
If your changes are not conflicting with the changes of other contributors you will see a green `Create pull request` button on the summary page.
Clicking it will take you to a new page where you can optionally add a short description and comment to your pull request.
On this page you'll find the green `Create pull request` button again.
Clicking it will forward your changes to the maintainers of the `chemotion_saurus` GitHub repository.
The maintainers will review the pull request and then merge your changes into the website.

### Contributors with write access to the `chemotion_saurus` GitHub repository

For advanced contributions to the Docusaurus, you can clone the repository and directly push your changes (follow the instructions in the [maintenance chapter](documentation/maintaining#development)).
Successful changes are directly deployed online.
You can check [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/actions/workflows/build.yml) to see if your changes are successfully merged.
More information about GitHub Actions (in general and for the Chemotion ELN) can be found in the [testing chapter](development/ci).
The landing (start) page can be edited [on GitHub](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/edit/main/src/pages/index.js).

## New Page

- use `.mdx` as filename ending in GitHub
- at the top of every page, insert the following metadata section:

```
---
id: videos_eln
sidebar_label: Videos
title: Introduction Videos
---
```

`id:` The unique document id. By default, a document id is same as the name of the document (without the extension).

`title:` Prompted on the page.

`sidebar_label:` Optional. Shortened name to be displayed in the TOC.

- after you have inserted a new page, add its `id` from the metadata section at the top of the file to the [TOC (table of content)](#toc).

- short links for creating a new page on GitHub:

  - [new Chemotion ELN documentation page](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/new/main/docs/eln)

  - [new REPO documentation page](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/new/main/docs/repo)

## Markdown

### Assets

#### images, gifs, videos, files

Images can be embedded in Markdown or HTML, the latter allowing for special configurations (optional `width` and `height` etc.) or if the image is inside an HTML tag.
The `![...]` in Markdown or `alt={...}` in HTML/React creates an `alt` tag for an additional title, if the image loading fails.
Note that the image paths for Markdown and HTML differ, which is caused by different treatment of Markdown and React (which creates the HTML) in Docusaurus.

Inserting an image in Markdown:

```md
![Export Menu](/img/export_menu.png)
```

Inserting an image in HTML (React):

```js
<img
  src={require("@site/static/img/export_menu.png").default}
  width={"30px"}
  height={"30px"}
  alt={"replacement_title"}
/>
```

#### SVG

SVGs require special treatment. First import them as React component and then insert them in your text with `className="logo"`:

```js
import Sample from "@site/static/img/sample.svg";
// more content here
<Sample title="Sample" className="logo" width={"30px"} height={"30px"} />;
```

### Buttons and Icons

#### regular buttons with text and icon content

For creating buttons use a button function and import it on the page. Every button gets a <b>color</b> and can have multiple text elements and icons <b>mixed</b> in its content.
For icon buttons get icons from [https://fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/) and import them on the page.
The color palette is from the [Infima library](https://infima.dev/docs/components/button).
For example, the following code snippet...

```
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'
import { faChartBar, faCheck } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
import { Btn } from '@site/src/js/btn.js'

<Btn mixed={[faChartBar, " 1", faCheck]} color={"secondary"}/>
```

...produces <Btn mixed={[faChartBar, " 1", faCheck]} color={"warning"}/>

#### special buttons

To create a button different from the regular one, e.g., with a different size, you need to use a React button with `<button></button>` tags.
You can change the size of a button in its style attribute with values in `%`, pixel (`px`), `rem` or `em`. Common icon sizes inside buttons are `xs`, `sm` and `lg`.

```
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'
import { faPlus, faShareAlt } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'

<button className={"button button--sm button--success"} style={{padding:"2px", height: "50%", width: "50%"}}>
<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="lg"/>
</button>

<button className={"button button--sm button--success"} style={{padding:"2px", height: "40px", width: "40px"}}>
<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="sm"/>
</button>
```

<button
  className={"button button--sm button--success"}
  style={{ padding: "2px", height: "50%", width: "50%" }}
>
  <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="lg" /> long text
</button>

<button
  className={"button button--sm button--success"}
  style={{ padding: "2px", height: "40px", width: "40px" }}
>
  <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="sm" /> tall
</button>

### Downloadable Files

If you want to provide one or multiple file(s) to download directly form the manual,
upload them to the files folder on [GitHub](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/upload/main/static/files)
and insert a Download Button with the (comma-separated) filepath(s) in `files` and the button text in `text` :

```
import { DownloadBtn } from '@site/src/js/download_files.js'

<p><DownloadBtn files={['/chemotionsaurus/files/template_sample_import.xlsx, docker-compose.yml']}  text={"Download XLSX Template here "}/></p>
```

### Escape signs

Escape characters that are part of the Markdown syntax with `\`.

### Formatting

#### Color

colored letters:

```js
<span style={{ color: "yellow" }}>some text</span>
```

colored background:

```js
<span style={{ background: "yellow" }}>some text</span>
```

#### Strikethrough

```html
<del>deleted text</del>
```

### Headings

To create a heading, add pound signs (`#`) in front of a word or phrase.
The number of `#` you use determines the heading level. A single `#` designates the top level.

### Info Boxes

Highlighted info boxes ([like on the eln intro page](eln)) with further information are called `Admonitions` in [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions).

### Line Breaks

Insert <b>two white spaces</b> at the end of the line.

### Links

Links can be created via Markdown or React:

The link structure in Markdown:

```md
[title](slug)
```

... and in React:

```js
import Link from "@docusaurus/Link";

<Link to="/path">Title</Link>;
```

#### external

In Markdown:

```md
[www.chemotion.net](https://www.chemotion.net)
```

In React:

```js
<Link to="https://www.chemotion.net">www.chemotion.net</Link>
```

#### internal

In Markdown, link to another page within the documentation using its `slug` or `id` (in case a `slug` is not available):

```md
[contact](specific_contact)
```

Link to another chapter on the same page using the last segment of the URL.
For example, link to `eln.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/instructions#toc` by using

```md
[link to TOC](#toc)
```

In React insert a link to another page using the relative path after the base url `/chemotionsaurus/`:

```js
<Link to="/docs/eln/structure">Structure of the Chemotion ELN</Link>
```

:::caution Recommendation
For links to internal pages it is not recommended to use https links from the server, where the website is hosted.
In order for links to resolve independently of the host, use Markdown syntax with relative internal linking.
For example, better use `[samples](elements/samples)` instead of `[contact](https://www.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/ui/elements/samples)`.

### Lists

#### ordered

random number with a dot

```
1. text
1. text1
1. text2
```

1. text
1. text1
1. text2

#### unordered

```
* text
- text1
```

- text

* text1

### Table

```
| header 1 | header 2 |
|---|---|
| field 1  |  field 2 |
```

### Text Formatting

<b>bold</b>

```
<b>bold</b>
```

`highlight elements, e. g. UI elements`

```
`Collection Bar`
```

### Hints & Errors

#### Links or insertion of images or files are not resolved in Markdown

For writing content in the [Docusaurus framework](https://docusaurus.io) it is generally recommended to use Markdown for the most content instead of pure HTML/CSS or React.
Some things are easier to style in React than in Markdown (e. g. buttons) and some things can be done in Markdown or in React (e. g. [links](#links), [images](#assets)).
If you write a paragraph in Markdown, mix it with React elements and then insert Markdown links, it could be the case that the Markdown links are not resolved on the web page.
Replace them with React elements.

## TOC

The TOC on the left of every documentation page must be manually updated via <b>[sidebars.js](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/edit/main/sidebars.js)</b> on GitHub.
If you have inserted a new page or want to change the order, change it there.

## Versioning

Currently, versioning is not enabled for the Chemotion ELN part of the documentation.
However, this can be adapted in the future. To create a new documentation version based on the latest content in the `docs Chemotion ELN` directory follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository of chemotion_saurus on your machine. This is necessary because a lot of files and folders will be added through npm.
1. In `docusaurus.config.js`: Change the `current` version to the new version and add the previous version to the other versions below.
1. In `sidebar Chemotion ELN.js`, add the new version to the `Versions` category.
1. After the first three steps, you can create a new version with `npm run docusaurus docs:version:elnID <former version number>`, e. g. `npm run docusaurus docs:version:elnID 0.9`.
   The version number should be the <b>last</b> version, but not the latest/current. The latest version will be stored in `docs/eln` folder and should be the version that is currently under development.
   `npm run docusaurus docs:version ...` creates a new folder with the version number, that ideally should not be edited anymore.
   For example: you are planning a new version 0.10, that is already the current version of the code.
   Then you probably have a version 0.8 and a current version with the label 0.9 (but not with a versioned folder 0.9) in Docusaurus.
   Now you create a version 0.9 through the npm command. Your current version gets bumped to 0.10 and is stored in `docs Chemotion ELN` and you will have one more versioned folders: 0.9 and 0.8.
   If you want to version the repository part of the documentation add the `lastVersion` and `versions` keys to the `"@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs"` plugin with the `id: "repoID"` in `docusaurus.config.js`
   and follow the steps above.
1. If versioning is enabled you have to use a separate TOC for each part of the documentation.
   Use [**sidebarELN.js**](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/edit/main/sidebarELN.js) for
   the Chemotion ELN part and [**sidebarsREPO.js**](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/edit/main/sidebarsREPO.js)
   for the Repository part instead of [**sidebars.js**](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/edit/main/sidebars.js) for all parts.
   Before that, the different TOCs probably need to be updated.
1. After enabling versioning it is important to change your relative imports - in case you used those before - to absolute imports because with versioning a lot more roots will be added to your Docusaurus:

```js
- import Foo from '../src/components/Foo';
+ import Foo from '@site/src/components/Foo';
```
