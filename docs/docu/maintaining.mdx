:::info
This page contains general information on how to set up a Docusaurus instance anywhere.
It follows the workflow used at KIT using Linux (Ubuntu), GitHub, and npm, but the principles can be adapted to other hosts, OS, etc..
:::

## Installation Process
### Requirements
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install npm or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- On Linux, macOS or WSL: Install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to install Node and npm. If you prefer yarn over npm, you can install yarn through npm, if you have npm already installed.

### Installation
Docusaurus can be installed via npm. For a detailed explanation have a look at the [official Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation).

### Configuration File
Configurations are placed in `docusaurus.config.js` at the root directory of your Docusaurus installation. For further explanations look at the [official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docusaurus.config.js).

### Update
See the [official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#updating-your-docusaurus-version).

## File structure
### Assets
Assets (images, gifs, videos, etc.) are stored inside the `static` directory. Look at the [chapter for contributors](contributing#assets) to see how to import them.
Video links from YouTube (optionally with preview) can be embedded using HTML.

### CSS
Custom CSS and SCSS is placed in `src/css` and must be named in the [configuration file](#configuration-file). The CSS is then automatically imported on every content page.
```js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        docs:false,
        blog: {
          showReadingTime: true
        },
        theme: {
          customCss: require.resolve('./src/css/custom.css'),
        },
      },
    ],
  ]
```

### Markdown
The main content of Docusaurus is written in Markdown files (`.md` or `.mdx` file format).
The `.mdx` format is recommended, because it supports React.
For detailed description look into the [chapter for contributors](contributing).

### Paths
Setting paths can get complicated when you are [deploying](#deployment) your website under another directory on the server or if you are using [versioning](#versioning).
Detailed information can be found in the [Docusaurus documentation about assets](https://docusaurus.io/docs/static-assets) and [versioning](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning#use-absolute-import-within-the-docs)
as well as in the [chapter for contributors](contributing).

### React/JavaScript
React is the main frontend framework in Docusaurus. Beside React components in MarkdownX you can create your own React or pure JavaScript snippets in `.js` files saved in every directory, where content pages in MarkdownX can occur. Namely in:
- `docs`
- `blog`
- `src/pages`

### Table of contents
The TOC (`sidebars.js`) is a JavaScript module. It must contain every single page that you wish to be visible.
If you create a new page add its `slug` or `id` here. The structure of a nested TOC is also defined there.

## Search bar
### Set Up
Docusaurus can be enhanced with a search function. It is integrated in the `@docusaurus/preset-classic`.
If other presets or plugins are used, additional steps may be needed for setting up a search function.
The default search function is offered by Algolia. The best way is to integrate the search function after Docusaurus is fully set up and went online.
This is because your URL need to be publicly available in order to apply the Algolia search function.

If you plan to use a more customized search (e. g. with your own index) look at the [Docusaurus official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/search)
or the Algolia and DocSearch documentations. Algolia itself offers different options.
One of them is free, if you have a non-profit documentation website and the website is publicly available (i. e. not behind a firewall).
It is also recommended to have a fixed URL that does not change, otherwise you have to tell Algolia your new URL.
Algolia needs the URL to crawl your website every 24 hours. The built index is then stored on the Algolia servers.
For the free plan you must [register your website for DocSearch provided by Algolia](https://docsearch.algolia.com/apply/).
After that it can take several days until Algolia has checked your website and sent you an e-mail with instructions on how to set up their search function.
It is important to know that the instructions from the e-mail are general for clients and more complicated than it is necessary and useful(!) for Docusaurus.
<b>Do not follow all instructions from Algolia when using Docusaurus!</b>
It is mostly just necessary to insert a key and the index name in `docusaurus.config.js` and save those values (key and index name) as environment variables:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  themeConfig: {
    // ...
    algolia: {
      appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
      apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      indexName: 'YOUR_INDEX_NAME',
    },
  },
};
```
Algolia also provides the ability to create an account for accessing statistics and configuring their products: [Algolia Sign Up](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up).
If you are using a free plan it is not necessary to use an account because you are very limited in configurations and your configuration options are on the Docusaurus site.
If you encounter problems with your search you can directly access the [Algolia API](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/getting-started/what-is-the-api-client/javascript/?client=javascript) written in different programming languages or write the Algolia customer service.
Here are small snippets in JavaScript and Python to check if your search works:
```js
// npm install algoliasearch

import algoliasearch from 'algoliasearch';

const client = algoliasearch('YOUR_APP_ID', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
console.log(client);
```
```py
# pip install --upgrade 'algoliasearch>=2.0,<3.0'

from algoliasearch.search_client import SearchClient

client = SearchClient.create('YOUR_APP_ID', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
index = client.init_index('YOUR_INDEX_NAME');
index.search('YOUR_SEARCH_WORD');
```
Error messages are also displayed in the browser console of a production Docusaurus.

## Presets, Plugins and Themes
Presets are a bundle of themes and plugins that define the layout and offer functionalities like the search bar.
Find more information about presets [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/presets).
The default preset maintains one docs and one blog instance.
If you want to serve multiple docs instances, e.g., for [versioning](#versioning) you need to replace this property in the preset with multiple plugins in the [configuration file](#configuration-file).

For example, if you want to install two versions of the documentation for manual A,
one for version 0.8 the other for version 0.9, set `docs:false` in the `preset` property
and add a property `@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs` under the `plugins` property on the level of the preset.
If you want to serve another manual B in the same docusaurus instance, you need to add a second property `@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs`.
The blog instance is still initialized in the classic preset.
```js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        docs:false,
        blog: {
          showReadingTime: true
        },
        theme: {
          customCss: require.resolve('./src/css/custom.css'),
        },
      },
    ],
  ]

plugins: [
      "@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs",
    {
      id: "A",
      showLastUpdateTime: true,
      showLastUpdateAuthor: true,
      editUrl:'...',
      sidebarPath: require.resolve('./sidebarsA.js'),
      path: "docs/A",
      routeBasePath: "docs/A",
      lastVersion: "current",
        versions: {
          current: {
            label: 'A 0.9',
          },
          '0.8': {
            label: 'A 0.8',
            path: 'version-0.8',
          },
        }
      }
  ]
  ,
  [
    "@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs",
    {
      id: "B",
      showLastUpdateTime: true,
      showLastUpdateAuthor: true,
      editUrl:'...',
      sidebarPath: require.resolve('./sidebarsB.js'),
      path: "docs/B",
      routeBasePath: "/docs/B",
    },
  ],
}
```
Themes are an addition to presets and plugins, but define the layout rather than the underlying structure.
For more options visit the [official Docusaurus Documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/using-themes).
You can also create your own themes under `src/theme`.
## Layout
See the [official Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/styling-layout).
## Versioning
For adding multiple versions of one documentation to Docusaurus look at the [plugin chapter](#presets-plugins-and-themes)
to see how it is configured in the [configuration file](#configuration-file).
To know how to install it look at the example in the [chapter for contributors](contributing#versioning).

## Version Control System (e. g. GitHub)
The Docusaurus instance can be saved in a VCS to enable development by multiple people.
A VCS is also needed to enable [online editing](#contribution-to-online-version-via-verison-control-system) and online Continuous Integration/Deployment.
Docusaurus supports the usage of the `dotenv` npm package. For that, import it in the [configuration file](#configuration-file). Environment variables are typically used there.
```js
require('dotenv').config()
module.exports = {
  ...
}
```
Environment variables can be saved in a `.env` file or stored as [secrets in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) or GitLab.
The latter option is also useful for [Continuous Deployment](#via-github-actions). If Docusaurus is developed locally in addition to Continuous Deployment on GitHub or GitLab,
it is necessary that every developer has access to the `.env` file, which should not be shared on the VCS. For that, save it in another place or create dummy environment variables.

## Development
There are two main ways to contribute to Docusaurus instance: either develop within a local Docusaurus installation or change the content of an online Docusaurus website via Version Control System (e. g. GitHub or GitLab).
One of the important features of Docusaurus is the ability to edit a Documentation page via a VCS without the need for a locally installed Docusaurus and advanced programming knowledge.

### Local installation
The Docusaurus development is based on npm. To change the configurations or script some JSX it is
necessary to install Docusaurus and the [requirements](#requirements).
There are two scenarios: 1. you are the creator and maybe admin of an Docusaurus instance, or 2. you are contributing to an existing Docusaurus instance.
#### creator (or admin) of a Docusaurus instance
- Install Docusaurus locally: See the [installation chapter](#installation).
- Configure and develop the Docusaurus instance
- Create a repository on your favorite VCS
- Push the locally developed Docusaurus instance to your VCS.
Normally hidden files, node, yarn or Docusaurus packages, build directories and maybe additional files are in the `.gitignore`, so they will not be pushed. But they can also be created easily locally or for deployment and it is also not useful to share them.
#### contributor to a running Docusaurus instance
- Clone the repository containing the Docusaurus instance to your machine
- Install the [requirements](#requirements)
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Change code, write documentation, or blog content
- Commit and push

#### develop and run
You can locally run a Docusaurus instance on localhost on default port 3000:
```sh
npm start
```
To run the Docusaurus instance on localhost on port 3001 or another port number:
```sh
npm start -- --port 3001
```
Check if your Docusaurus instance could be build correctly. This command is also helpful before you push code in order solve errors and detect incorrectly resolved links:
```sh
npm run build
```

#### clear cache
Sometimes it is useful if you encounter errors, e.g., during the build process:
```sh
npm run clear
```

#### debug
Because Docusaurus is a high level framework, there is no dedicated way of live debugging.
You can use the [debug plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-debug) to get some static information on your docusaurus site.
Another solution is to look into the `.docusaurus` folder. For debugging the JSX code you can use the browser console or other debuggers for JavaScript/React.

### Contribution to online version via Version Control System
Every documentation page can be edited online via the `Edit this page` button.
To enable this, insert a link for editing in your VCS (e. g. `https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/edit/master/`) in the [configuration file](#configuration-file),
usually under `presets/docs/editUrl` or `plugins/<instance>/editUrl`.

## Deployment
A static Docusaurus website can be build with a npm or yarn command and then only this `build` directory needs to be pushed to a server:
```sh
npm run build --if-present
```
:::caution Recommendation
If you are serving your Docusaurus website under another directory than the default `/` you may encounter problems with paths for assets (images, files etc.).
Look in the Docusaurus documentation for solutions: [https://docusaurus.io/docs/static-assets](https://docusaurus.io/docs/static-assets).
:::
### Via GitHub Actions
Docusaurus can be fully built and deployed via GitHub or GitLab.
For that a workflow file in yml is needed, where the current code is checked out (e. g. on every push),
build via npm or yarn and the so created build directory pushed to a server via SSH.
An example workflow for Continuous Deployment via SSH can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml).
For details have a look at the [chapter on continuous integration](../eln/development/ci).
