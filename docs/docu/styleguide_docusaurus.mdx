# Images
* If you're adding an image to illustrate a paragraph, place the image after the corresponding paragraph.

# Terms
* Refer to the Chemotion Electronic Lab Notebook as ` Chemotion ELN`.
* Refer to the the Chemotion spectra editor for analytical data as `ChemSpectra`.
* Refer to the repository as `Chemotion Repository`.

# Titles
* Capitalize only the first word of a title.
* Use all low caps starting at header level 4 (`####`).

# Lists
* Capitalize the first word of each list entry.
* Use regular punctuation within list entries.

# Tables
* Do not capitalize words inside tables.

# Automatic style checking
On every push to the chemotion_saurus repository an automatic style guide parser is triggered.
The parser automatically fixes incorrect terms and pushed the corrections, which will be deployed along with the subsequent push from a user.
If tables contain upper-cased words or the committed file is missing in the table of contents, warning or error messages are printed in the `Style Guide Parser` step in the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/actions).
Style checking can be skipped by including `skip style guide` in the commit message.

:::caution Recommendation
The Style Guide Parser works best for natural language text like in the chemistry manual of this documentation. It may be better to skip the Style Guide Parser (`skip style guide` in the commit message) if you are using the [terms](#terms) with an extra spelling, e.g., "chemotion_ELN" as name for the Ruby app, like in the developer section of this documentation.
