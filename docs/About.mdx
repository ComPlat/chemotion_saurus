# Brief project description

  <p>
This project aims for the development of a freely available infrastructure for research data management through the development of two independent IT systems namely an electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and a chemistry web repository. With the tools that will be established by our project group it will be possible to integrate modern web-techniques into the routine work of academic researchers, thereby increasing the amount of available data and improving the quality of the information obtained and published.

The aim of this project is to make a substantial contribution to securing research results in a cost-effective and simple manner, and to optimally network in particular chemists (initially with each other and in a second step with other disciplines). The new model provides a combination of recording and documentation as well as publication and storage of data sets.

The necessary IT structures for modern documentation of research data are developed within the scope of this project, will be summarized in an electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) and will be provided and distributed as OPEN SOURCE. The ELN will be completed by the establishment and hosting of the web-repository, for which a direct connection to the ELN enables a fast and easy transfer of selected research information.

Free access and free use by academic researchers is one principle of this project allowing and promoting collaborative work and scientific exchange among scientists.
