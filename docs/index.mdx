## Project Goals

The ComPlat (Compound Platform) project is developing freely available infrastructure resources for management of research data through the development of two independent, but closely compatible, IT systems namely:

- Chemotion ELN - an electronic laboratory notebook (ELN), and
- Chemotion Repository - a data repository for Chemistry available on the web.

With the ELN, it is possible to integrate state-of-the-art Research Data Management techniques into the routine work of academic researchers, thereby improving the data that is obtained as well as the quality of information that is published.
The ELN is complemented by the Repository, to which it can be connected directly for fast, easy and secure transfer of selected research information for sharing and archiving.

By providing an [open-sourced](#source-code-and-licenses) tool - the ELN, alongside a platform - the Repository, this project is making substantial contribution towards increasing research productivity in a cost-effective and simple manner. While these were initially targeted at chemists, they developing rapidly with increased interest from other domains, particularly biochemists.

Free access and free use by academic researchers is one principle of this project allowing and promoting collaborative work and scientific exchange among scientists.

## Developers

The Chemotion ELN and Repository was initiated by the working group of Stefan Bräse at the Institute of Organic Chemistry (IOC)/Institute of Biological and Chemical Systems (IBCS) of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). Currently, the software is developed by a team working at the the north campus of the KIT and in collaboration with developers at the universities Jena, Braunschweig, Halle and RWTH Aachen.
The Chemotion ELN is developed for chemists and other scientists working in related fields.

We would like to thank the many other institutions and developers who contributed code, ideas and finished subcomponents. The Chemotion ELN could only come into being with the support of developers from NinjaConcept and Cubuslab. Further sub-components are available through the cooperation with NMRdb and SciFinder.
The project has been funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and by the state of Baden-Württemberg.
