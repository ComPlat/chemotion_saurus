The ComPlat (Compound Platform) project is developing freely available infrastructure resources for management of research data through the development of two independent, but closely compatible, IT systems namely:

- [Chemotion ELN](docs/eln) - an electronic laboratory notebook (ELN),
- [Chemotion Repository](docs/repo) - a data repository for Chemistry available on the web, and
- [Chemotion LabIMotion](docs/labimotion) - a software tool empowering scientists to design and customize new modules tailored to their unique needs.

With the ELN, it is possible to integrate state-of-the-art Research Data Management techniques into the routine work of academic researchers, thereby improving the data that is obtained as well as the quality of information that is published.
The ELN is complemented by the Repository, to which it can be connected directly for fast, easy and secure transfer of selected research information for sharing and archiving.

By providing an open-sourced tool - the ELN, alongside a platform - the Repository, this project is making substantial contribution towards increasing research productivity in a cost-effective and simple manner. While these were initially targeted at chemists, they developing rapidly with increased interest from other domains, particularly biochemists.

Free access and free use by academic researchers is one principle of this project allowing and promoting collaborative work and scientific exchange among scientists.

## Background & Current Development

The [Chemotion ELN](docs/eln) and the [Chemotion Repository](docs/repo) was initiated by the working group of Stefan Bräse at the Institute of Organic Chemistry (IOC)/Institute of Biological and Chemical Systems (IBCS) of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).

Currently, the software is developed by a team working at the the north campus of the KIT and in collaboration with developers at the universities of Jena, Braunschweig, Halle and RWTH Aachen.

We would like to thank the many other institutions and developers who contributed code, ideas and finished subcomponents. The Chemotion ELN could only come into being with the support of developers from NinjaConcept and Cubuslab. Further sub-components are available through the cooperation with NMRdb and SciFinder. The project has been funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and by the state of Baden-Württemberg.

## [Contact Us](/helpdesk)

If Chemotion is used in your laboratory, we would be very happy to receive a short message. Please let us know via the [Helpdesk](/helpdesk). This allows us to document the number of users in order to track the interest in Chemotion ELN.

We also value all requests, feedback, suggestions and criticism that you have:

- You can use the [Helpdesk](/helpdesk) to contact us, it is our preferred medium of communication.
- If you are experienced user/developer, and your message is developer-oriented, please open an issue directly on our [repository](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/issues). Please give as many details as possible (preferably also images or screenshots) to facilitate the understanding of the issue.

### Workshops, Demonstrations and Q&A sessions

There are different ways to become familiar with Chemotion ELN and forms of support that we provide. The training activities for Chemotion are supported by the NFDI4Chem team.

- Please visit us in our [Chemotion Live Demo + Q&A session (every three months)](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/index.php/event/chemotion-eln-qa-session/), or
- Request an introduction to the ELN or a workshop for working groups using the [Helpdesk](/helpdesk).
