# Template Guidelines

## Design Principles

<SubTitle text="Generic Elements, Segments, and Datasets are organized by layers and fields." />

Generic **[Elements](./designer/elements/)**, **[Segments](./designer/segments/)**, and **[Datasets](./designer/datasets/)** are structured using **[Components](./designer/components/)**, which are introduced as layers and fields. Each generic element, segment, or dataset has the capacity to encompass multiple layers, and within each layer, there is the potential for multiple fields to be present. This hierarchical arrangement allows for a flexible and comprehensive organization of data and information.

<h3>What is Element, Segment, Dataset?</h3>

In case you are not familiar with the terms **Element**, **Segment**, and **Dataset**, here is a brief overview:

- **Element**: An element is a fundamental entity which represent an essential aspect within your domain. For example, the sample element or reaction element in Chemotion ELN.
- **Segment**: A segment is a distinct section that usually has its own identifiable characteristics. You can use it to represent a specific subset of an element.
- **Dataset**: Within the system, a predefined segment named "Analyses" is provided to capture analysis results. The dataset of the analysis comprises individual data points. Additionally, through **[Metadata Auto Mapper](./user/datasets/metadata-mapper)**, metadata extraction from raw files is automatically triggered, facilitating mapping into the dataset.

<h3>How do they relate to each other?</h3>

This diagram shows how scientists organize research information (processes, materials, devices, datasets) and how these map onto LabIMotion concepts: Generic Element, Generic Segment, and Generic Dataset. It highlights how details and datasets are linked, emphasizing that building blocks can represent experimental structures and analysis layers.

<h3>How are they structured?</h3>

The figure illustrates how templates can be structured at three levels: Element, Segment, and Dataset. Each level can contain multiple layers, and each layer can have multiple fields. This hierarchical structure allows for a flexible and comprehensive organization of data and information.

## Roles and Resources

### ðŸŽ¨ Designer Role

The Designer role is dedicated to creating templates that align with specific applications. These templates serve as the foundation for user interfaces. Take a moment to explore the **[Designer Guides](./designer)** and uncover the possibilities that await you!

### ðŸ”¬ User Role

Users are individuals who can choose from a range of pre-designed templates, each meticulously crafted by Designers to suit different applications. Visit the **[User Guides](./user)** and delve into the available functionalities.

With the transition from our beta version to the official release version, we're thrilled to introduce a groundbreaking transformation. We have redefined the roles to enhance clarity and streamline user interactions. This new approach divides users into two distinct roles: **Designer** and **User**, each with specific responsibilities and permissions tailored to their needs.
