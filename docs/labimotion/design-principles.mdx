# Template Guidelines

## Design Principles

<SubTitle text="Generic Elements, Segments, and Datasets are organized by layers and fields." />

Generic [Elements](./guides/designer/elements/), Segments, and Datasets are structured using Components, which are introduced as layers and fields. Each generic element, segment, or dataset has the capacity to encompass multiple layers, and within each layer, there is the potential for multiple fields to be present. This hierarchical arrangement allows for a flexible and comprehensive organization of data and information.

<FigCaption text="labimotion_modules" />
