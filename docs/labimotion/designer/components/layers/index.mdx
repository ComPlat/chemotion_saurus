A **Layer** in LabIMotion denotes a distinct level or stratum within a template. It serves as a foundational building block, organizing and compartmentalizing various aspects of data and functionality. Each layer holds specific operations, visual representations, or functional components that contribute to the overall structure and behavior of the template.
