The **Preview & Versions** feature feature provides a preview of the user's page, allowing you to view the layout of a specific version by selecting it from the [Version List](#version-list) on the left side.

Some components remain functional in this preview mode, such as entering text into a text component or selecting an option from a dropdown. However, certain interactions, like dragging and dropping a sample, may not work because they require an initial draggable item.

## Version List

The **Version List** displays the latest 10 released template versions, including their unique version UUIDs and release timestamps in UTC format.

### <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faEye} /> Preview this version

The preview feature is available not only for the current version but also for all versions.

### <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faReply} /> Retrieve

You can retrieve each version of templates, and once retrieved, it will be in draft status. You need to release it if you want to use the retrieved version.

### <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faDownload} /> Download

Each version of the templates can be downloaded in a file. The file is in the `.json` format, and the file name is the system prefix plus template name plus the version UUID. For example, if the system prefix is `abc`, the template name is `template1` and the version UUID is `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`, the file name will be `abc_template1-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000.json`.

### <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTrashCan} /> Delete

You can delete the old versions if you don't want to keep them. However, please note that once deleted, this action cannot be undone.
