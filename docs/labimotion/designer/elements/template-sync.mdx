## Synchronize from Template Hub

Effortlessly synchronize templates suitable for your application from the Template Hub, enabling you to harness the collaborative contributions of scientists. This approach is highly recommended.

As a [Designer](/docs/labimotion/design-principles#-designer-role), you can sync collective contributed templates from the Template Hub to your instance. This allows users to seamlessly work with the templates and publish their work step-by-step. See [Template Sync. & Publish](/docs/labimotion/template-sync-and-publish).

## Exchange Across Instances

For those who own more than one instance and wish to align templates between them, you, as a Designer, can simply:

- **Export Element and Its Template**: Use this function to export the element and its templates from the instance.
- **Import Element and Its Template**: Use this function to import the element and its templates into the instance.
