Each element comes equipped with both the **Copy** and **Split** functions, providing users with versatile options for element management. Whether duplicating existing content or creating a new element from the original while establishing parent-child relationships, these features empower users to customize their data effectively.

## Copy Element

The **Copy** function enables you to create a duplicate of an Element for your content. Once you click on the "Copy" button, select the Collection that you want to assign the new Element to, the data will be copied to the new Element. You can then edit the Element name and other details as needed. This enables you to efficiently replicate complex content without starting from scratch.

## Split Element

Scientists have conceptualized a new element to meet their specific requirements. Utilizing the **Split** feature, users can now create a new element from an existing one, establishing a parent-child relationship in the process.
