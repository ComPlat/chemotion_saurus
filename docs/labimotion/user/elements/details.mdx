## Details modal for elements

The details of the element are generated from the template designed by the designer. Clicking on a desired element from the list opens the details modal, displaying the 'Properties' tab by default.

### Properties tab

The Properties tab serves as the primary section for an element. It contains essential information and allows users to drag elements, samples, or molecules from the element list.

By default, the first layer is expanded. An **Expand/Collapse** button is available to expand or collapse all layers simultaneously, making it easier to display the full content at once or to quickly hide sections and locate the desired layer.

### Analyses tab

The Analyses tab enables users to add analyses containing analytical data. In the **Content** field, users can input experimental results and upload experimental datasets. Users can then select the appropriate **Type (Chemical Methods Ontology)** from the provided list. For more details, please refer [Ontology](/docs/eln/ui/ontology). The uploaded files can be converted to spectra format files according to the converter profile.

### Attachment tab

The Attachment tab allows users to attach additional files/images to this element. If a user uploads images in the Attachment tab, the first image will be shown in the list.

By uploading Word files, Excel files, and presentation files, you can directly edit the files using the OnlyOffice service.

### Segment tab

If segments are released and activated for this element, you can view them in the tab list. For additional information, please refer to the **[Segments](/docs/labimotion/user/segments)** section.
