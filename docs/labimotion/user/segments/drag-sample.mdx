Users can utilize drag-and-drop functionality to add samples to segment.

## Drag samples to field

When dragging a sample from the sample list to a field within a segment, the system maintains the link between the sample and the segment. Unlike dragging a sample to an element field, dragging a sample to a segment field does not create a new element; instead, it directly links the sample to the segment. If a user moves the element from one collection to another, and its segment contains a linked sample, the linked sample will not be moved along with the element.
