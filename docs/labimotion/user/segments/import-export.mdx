import { FigCaption, SubTitle, Reader } from "@site/src/js/layout";

<SubTitle text="The export/import collection feature includes segments." />
<Reader text="User" />

Whether you are exporting or importing basic elements as a collection, the associated segments and dataset information are included.

:::info

The export/import collection includes generic segments; however, only exports and imports to the same instance will be included, or the generic segment template synchronized from **[LabIMotion Hub](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/home/genericHub)** by the designer will be included.
