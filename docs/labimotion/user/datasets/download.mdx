### Dataset Excel

Dataset Excel is a file in **.xlsx** format that includes the metadata of the device or the system-generated data or manually entered. A Dataset Excel includes: Description and Analytical Data, and we also attach the Measurement data from ChemSpectra.

![Metadata in xlsx format](/img/labimotion/dataset-excel.png)

- **Description**: Provides a brief overview of the fields. Because measurement data are supplied as additional sheets, a mapping between sheet names and file names is included to help users understand the file content structure.
- **Analytical Data (Ontology-Based Sheet Names)**: Contains analytical data that may be extracted from instruments or systems, or entered manually. The sheet name is derived from ontology terms.
- **Measurement**: Includes measurement data from [ChemSpectra](/docs/services/chemspectra).
