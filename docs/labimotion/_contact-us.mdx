**Get Assistance and Share Feature Requests**

Should you encounter any challenges on your website, please do not hesitate to [get in touch with us](mailto:chemotion-labimotion@lists.kit.edu). We stand ready to assist you in resolving these issues effectively.

**Feature Requests**

For innovative feature requests, we encourage you to create a post on our [Discussion](https://github.com/LabIMotion/labimotion/discussions) board. This method provides our core team with a more accurate gauge of the features in high demand, which is superior to GitHub issues, as the latter can be more challenging to prioritize.

We kindly request that you refrain from submitting Pull Requests for new features, especially substantial ones, as there may already be ongoing work or such features may be part of our future plans. Your first step should be to initiate a conversation with us!
