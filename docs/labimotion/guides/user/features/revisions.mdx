The history revision function provides a valuable safety net, enabling users to maintain the integrity of their work, track changes over time, and ensure that accidental or unwanted modifications can be easily corrected.

The history revision function allows users to view and revert to previous versions of a element, it includes:

### Version Tracking

When changes are made to a element or any piece of content, the system keeps a record of each version.

### Accessing Version History

Users can access the version history of a element

### Reverting Changes

Users can choose to revert back to a previous version of the element. This action restores the element to the selected version, effectively undoing any changes made after that point in time.
