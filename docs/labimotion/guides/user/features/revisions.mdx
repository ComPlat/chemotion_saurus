The **Revision** function provides a valuable safety net, enabling users to maintain the integrity of their work, track changes over time, and ensure that accidental or unwanted modifications can be easily corrected.

The **Revision** function is accessible as a button in the toolbar.

Clicking the **Revision** button opens a modal window. By default, a version history list is displayed on the left side. Specific version can be selected to view or revert to it with a single click.

The **Revision** function includes:

### Viewing Versions <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faEye} />

Each change made to the content is recorded upon saving. This allows for easy viewing and tracing back to previous versions.

### Reverting Changes <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faReply} />

Users can choose to revert back to a specific version. This action restores the data to the selected version, effectively undoing any changes made after that point in time.

### Delete Version <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTrashCan} />

If the old version is no longer needed, it can be deleted. This action is irreversible and  cannot be undone once completed.
