import { FigCaption, SubTitle, Reader } from "@site/src/js/layout";

<SubTitle text="Search Element with all fields." />
<Reader text="User" />

When the element has been added to the visible list of 'Tab Layout', the search function will be enabled. By clicking on the search bar, you can find a list of elements that allows you to perform searches.

The search modal has the same format as the detail modal. Substring search is available for 'Name' and 'Short Label'. For other fields, substring search is not yet available; please input the full text to perform a search.
