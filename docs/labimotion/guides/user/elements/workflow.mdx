## LabIMotion Workflow

LabIMotion assists scientists in creating customized modules tailored to their requirements. Within these modules, scientists can outline processes comprising a sequence of actions/steps aimed at achieving specific outcomes. Additionally, LabIMotion facilitates the construction of workflow logics using interactive diagrams.

A predefined workflow can be embedded in the element. Users do not need additional configuration to access the workflow; they simply need to follow the actual process by clicking 'Next' to proceed to the next step. Users can also view the workflow by clicking the (Workflow <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faSitemap} />) button.
