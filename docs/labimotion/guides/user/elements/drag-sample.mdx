Users can employ drag and drop functionality to add samples to the content of the element.

## Drag samples to field

When you drag a sample from the sample list to the element field, it becomes linked to the content of the element. There are three options for linking the sample:

- **Current**: This option is available when the sample is not already linked to any other elements. It links the sample directly to the current element.

- **Split**: This option splits the dragged sample and links it to the current element.

- **Copy**: This option creates a copy of the dragged sample and links the copy to the current element.

## Drag samples to table

When you drag a sample into the sample column of a table, the sample becomes linked to the table within the element. This action allows you to associate the sample with the specific data or information represented in the table.

## Decoupled sample

As decoupled samples has no structure, the drag-and-drop feature currently works seamlessly for those with a structure. However, for samples without a structure, such as decoupled samples, we use a standard molecule icon to represent them.
