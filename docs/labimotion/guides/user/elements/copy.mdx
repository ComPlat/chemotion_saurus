The **Copy** function enables you to create a duplicate of an Element for your content. Once you click on the "Copy" button, select the Collection that you want to assign the new Element to, the data will be copied to the new Element. You can then edit the Element name and other details as needed. This enables you to efficiently replicate complex content without starting from scratch.

Quickly learn from the video:

<YouTubeFrame

  title="Copy Element"
/>
<FigCaption text="LabIMotion: User - Copy Element" />
