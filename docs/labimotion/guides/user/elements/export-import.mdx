Previously, the Export/Import Collection function only supported basic elements such as samples and reactions. Due to the complexity of generic elements, their support was not initially included. However, as more users expressed interest in the possibility of Export/Import Collection supporting generic elements, we have expanded its capabilities to meet this demand.

Users can now utilize the Export/Import Collection function to export/import collections that contain generic elements within or across instances, provided that the required templates are available on the instances.

Kindly inquire with your designers to ensure that the necessary templates are available before proceeding with the Export/Import Collection function.
