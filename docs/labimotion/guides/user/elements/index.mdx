:::info Permissions and Configuration
The available elements must be defined by the designer first, then released and activated. The UI feature for generic elements needs to be either globally enabled or the user must be included in the allow list.

## Meaning

Chemistry has many subdisciplines and characteristics. Therefore, it's difficult to define one model for all applications. That's why we need Generic Elements. Domain experts define the attributes that fit their specific needs.

Generic elements include basic functions such as Collections (Move/Assign/Share...), Analysis, and Attachments, as well as additional functions like revision and workflow.


## Numbering and naming

Each element is numbered consecutively and displayed in the list of elements. The composition of the element short label is "User's name abbreviation"-"Element Prefix"-sequence.

## Update Element Counter

Users can update the element counter on the 'Account & Profile' page.
