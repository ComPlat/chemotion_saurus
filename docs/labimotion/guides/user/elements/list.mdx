:::info Permissions and Configuration
The available element must be defined by the designer first, then released and activated. The UI feature for generic elements needs to be either globally enabled or the user must be included in the allow list.
:::

A Generic Element utilizes the same data model entity as other static entities like samples and reactions. Initially, these elements are hidden in the 'Tab Layout' and users must drag them into the visible area to access them via the element list tabs.

The default sorting order for elements is based on the latest update time (in descending order) and they are not grouped by default.
