### Properties tab

The Properties Tab is the primary tab for an element; it contains essential information and allows users to drag elements, samples, or molecules from the element list.


### Analyses tab

The Analyses tab enables users to add analyses containing analytical data. In the **Content** field, users can input experimental results and upload experimental datasets. Users can then select the appropriate **Type (Chemical Methods Ontology)** from the provided list. For more details, please refer [Ontology](/doc/eln/ui/ontology). The uploaded files can be converted to spectra format files according to the converter profile.


### Attachment tab

The Attachment tab allows users to attach additional files/images to this element. If a user uploads images in the Attachment tab, the first image will be shown in the list.

By uploading Word files, Excel files, and presentation files, you can directly edit the files using the OnlyOffice service.


### Segment tab

If segments are released and activated for this element, you can view them in the tab list. For additional information, please refer to the 'Segment' section.
