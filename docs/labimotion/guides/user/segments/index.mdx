:::info Permissions and Configuration
The available segments must be defined by the designer first, then released and activated. The UI feature for generic segments needs to be either globally enabled or the user must be included in the allow list.
:::

## Meaning

The attributes of elements might not adequately address the varied needs of users. The generic segment operates as an extension model, enabling users to include extra information customized to their specific demands.

## Tab Layout

The available segments will initially appear in the hidden area of the `Tab Layout` Users need to drag them to the visible area to display them in the element list tabs.

However, if segments are created, they will be visible even if they are in the hidden area of the `Tab Layout`.

<FigCaption text="LabIMotion - Embedded a segment into sample." />

Depending on the design, the segments can be used for basic elements, such as samples or reactions, or for generic elements.
