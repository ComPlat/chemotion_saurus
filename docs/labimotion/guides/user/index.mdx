:::info Permissions
The system administrator needs to globally configure the UI feature for LabIMotion (generic elements, generic segments, and generic datasets). Otherwise, only users on the allow list will have access to the LabIMotion.
:::

LabIMotion is a versatile software enabling the creation of customizable modules tailored to scientists' requirements. It comprises Generic Elements, Segments, and Datasets organized using Components, presented as layers and fields. Each generic element, segment, or dataset can consist of multiple layers, and within each layer, various fields can be incorporated. This hierarchical structure ensures adaptable and thorough data organization, providing scientists with flexibility and comprehensive management of their information.
