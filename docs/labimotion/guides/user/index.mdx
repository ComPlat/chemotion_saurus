:::info Permissions
The system administrator needs to globally configure the UI feature for LabIMotion (generic elements, generic segments, and generic datasets). Otherwise, only users on the allow list will have access to the LabIMotion.
:::


LabIMotion is a software that provides the option to design new modules that can be adapted to the needs of the scientists. It includes Generic Elements, Segments, and Datasets. They are structured using Components, which are introduced as layers and fields. Each generic element, segment, or dataset has the capacity to encompass multiple layers, and within each layer, there is the potential for multiple fields to be present. This hierarchical arrangement allows for a flexible and comprehensive organization of data and information.
