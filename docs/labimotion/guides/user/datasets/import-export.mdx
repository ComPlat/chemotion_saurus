Whether you are exporting or importing basic elements as a collection, the associated segments and dataset information are included.

:::info
The export/import collection includes generic datasets; however, only exports and imports to the same instance will be included, or the generic dataset template synchronized from LabIMotion Hub by the designer will be included.
