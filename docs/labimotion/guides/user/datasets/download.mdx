### Metadata Excel

Metadata Excel is a file in xlsx format that includes the metadata of the device or the system-generated data or manually entered. A Metadata Excel includes: Description and Metadata, and we also attach the measurement data from ChemSpectra.

![Metadata in xlsx format](/img/labimotion/dataset-download_metadata.png)

- **Description**: A summary to provide a brief description of the fields in Metadata. Because the data of measurement are included as extra sheets/additional information, a mapping of the sheet name and file name is provided here for a better understanding of the file content structure.
- **'Metadata'**: The data of metadata is extracted from device or system via the power of **[ChemConverter](/docs/services/chemconverter)**, or manually entered. The name of this sheet comes from the ontology terms.
- **'Measurement'**: The measurement data from **[ChemSpectra](/docs/services/chemspectra)**.
