Effortless assignability to individual Elements.

The **Segment** function closely resembles the element function, enabling users to design and customize the user interface with comparable versatility. Just as with [Elements](elements/), you can meticulously shape and refine the interface of segments, tailoring their presentation to specific preferences. Notably, the defining characteristic of segments is their seamless assignability to individual [Elements](elements/). This unique attribute empowers users to enhance and fine-tune the layout and appearance of elements by strategically integrating segments, offering a dynamic and flexible approach to interface design.
