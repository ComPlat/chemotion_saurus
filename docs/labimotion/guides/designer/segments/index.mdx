The **Segment** function closely resembles the element function, enabling users to design and customize the user interface with comparable versatility. Just as with [Elements](elements/), you can meticulously shape and refine the interface of segments, tailoring their presentation to specific preferences. Notably, the defining characteristic of segments is their seamless assignability to individual [Elements](elements/). This unique attribute empowers users to enhance and fine-tune the layout and appearance of elements by strategically integrating segments, offering a dynamic and flexible approach to interface design.

## User Interface

### Segment Template List

Just like the Element template list, Segment templates are presented in a grid layout for your convenience. You have the following options:

- :white_check_mark: **Sort** the grid by clicking on the column headers.
- :white_check_mark: **Filter** the grid by clicking on the filter icon <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faList} size="lg"/> located at the right of the column headers.

You can refer to the video at [Element Template List](../designer/elements#element-template-list).
