You can build a template with a range of **[Components](designer/components/)**, and make it to match your needs.

:::info Permissions
The Designer role encompasses Element, Segment, and Dataset functions, which are accessible to individuals with designer permissions. If you cannot locate the **Generic Designer** option in the menu, kindly reach out to your system administrator for assistance.

## How it works

1. Choose the Element, Segmenet, or Dataset that you intend to work with. The system will automatically navigate you to the **Work Area**.
2. Utilize the **Preview Design** feature to gain a visual representation of the template's appearance.
3. Access the **Work Area** to integrate essential components, arrange them to your preferences, and establish the desired layout.
