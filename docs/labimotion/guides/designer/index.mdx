## Recommended practices

### Sync templates from Template Hub

Utilize the Template Hub, a user-friendly collaboration center designed for scientists to effortlessly share templates across different applications. Synchronizing templates through the Template Hub is a streamlined process.

Watch the video below to see how a designer can efficiently sync templates to your own instance.

3. Access the **Work Area** to integrate essential components, arrange them to your preferences, and establish the desired layout.
