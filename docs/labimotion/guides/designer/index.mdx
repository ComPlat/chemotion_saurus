You can work with a variety of component types, ranging from simple text fields to tables. This empowers you to construct intricate workflows tailored to your requirements.

As a Designer, you can take advantage of the following capabilities:

- Easily synchronize templates suitable for your application from the Template Hub. This approach allows you to benefit from the collaborative efforts of scientists and is **highly recommended**.
- A wide variety of **[Components](designer/components/)**, allowing you to approach your design methodically, step by step.

:::info[Permissions]

The Designer role encompasses Element, Segment, and Dataset functions, which are accessible to individuals with designer permissions. If you cannot locate the **Generic Designer** option in the menu, kindly reach out to your system administrator for assistance.

## Recommended practices

### Sync templates from Template Hub

Utilize the Template Hub, a user-friendly collaboration center designed for scientists to effortlessly share templates across different applications. Synchronizing templates through the Template Hub is a streamlined process.

Watch the video below to see how a designer can efficiently sync templates to your own instance.

Find templates that are suitable for your application in the **[LabIMotion Hub](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/home/genericHub)**.

## Getting Started

1. Choose the Element, Segment, or Dataset that you intend to work with, and then click on [**Template**](./template-features/index.mdx). The system will automatically navigate you to the [**Work Area**](./template-features/workarea.mdx).
2. Utilize the [**Preview Design**](./template-features/preview-design.mdx) feature to gain a visual representation of the template's appearance.
3. Access the [**Work Area**](./template-features/workarea.mdx) to integrate essential components, arrange them to your preferences, and establish the desired layout.
