## Preview

The preview feature is available not only for the current version but also for all versions.

## Retrieve

You can retrieve each version of templates, and once retrieved, it will be in draft status. You need to release it if you want to use the retrieved version.

## Download

Each version of the templates can be downloaded in JSON format and imported into other systems.

## Delete

You can delete the old versions if you don't want to keep them. However, please note that once deleted, this action cannot be undone.
