<Reader text="Designer" />

The **Preview Design** feature offers a peer view of the user's page, but it does not support the following types: dragging elements, dragging samples, and dragging molecules.

### Preview this version <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faClock} />

The preview feature is available not only for the current version but also for all versions.

### Retrieve <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faReply} />

You can retrieve each version of templates, and once retrieved, it will be in draft status. You need to release it if you want to use the retrieved version.

### Download <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faDownload} />

Each version of the templates can be downloaded in a file. The file is in the `.json` format, and the file name is the system prefix plus template name plus the version UUID. For example, if the system prefix is `abc`, the template name is `template1` and the version UUID is `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`, the file name will be `abc_template1-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000.json`.

### Delete <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTrashCan} />

You can delete the old versions if you don't want to keep them. However, please note that once deleted, this action cannot be undone.
