A template is a predefined structure designed for your applications. As a Designer, you can:

- Create a new template from scratch.
- Use public templates from the Template Hub by synchronizing them.
- Export/Import templates between instances.

The **Template** feature consists of two main areas:

* [**Work Area**](../template-features/workarea.mdx) – Where you design and modify templates.
* [**Preview & Versions**](../template-features/preview-design.mdx) – Allows you to review and manage different template versions.

Let's take a quick look at how templates work!
