When a restriction is applied, the layer is hidden. It will only be shown when the criteria are met. If there are multiple restrictions that have been applied, the layer will be displayed when any one of them is matched.

Just few steps to set up the restriction:

1. Click the **Restriction Setting** <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCogs} /> button on the top right corner of the layer.
2. Start to set up the condition - Layer, Field, and Value.
3. Done!
