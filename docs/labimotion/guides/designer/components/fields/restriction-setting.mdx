Similar to the [Restriction Setting](../layers/restriction-setting) function in the [Layers](../layers/). When a restriction is applied, the field is hidden. It will only be shown when the criteria are met. If there are multiple restrictions that have been applied, the field will be displayed when any one of them is matched.
