A **Field** can be thought of as a subcomponent within a layer. It encapsulates a single piece of data or a specific input/output element. Multiple "Fields" can coexist within a single "Layer," each contributing its unique properties to the layer's overall functionality.

## Create a Field

After creating a layer, you will notice an input field with a hint "Input new field name" next to the layer name. Simply enter the desired name for the field, ensuring that it consists of letters, numbers, and/or underscores ('_'). Then, click the <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} /> button to create the new field.

  <img src={fieldCreation} alt="LabIMotion - Create Field" />
</p>

The default field type is a [Text](fields/types/text) field. Change the field type using the dropdown menu. Depending on the field type different options are available.
You refer to the **[Available Field Types](fields/types/)** to find the right field type for you.

You can always add a hover info and a title. Change the order of fields by clicking the <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowUp} /> or <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faArrowDown} /> arrow-button in the field heading.
