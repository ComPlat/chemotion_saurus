A **Checkbox** type field is used to capture a binary choice, usually indicating an on/off or true/false decision. It serves as a simple :white_medium_square: allowing users to make a binary choice and can be employed as a restrictive field. Thus, values for the restriction must be entered as either "yes" or "no" (alternatively, "1" or "0").
