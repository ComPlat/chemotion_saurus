A **Datetime Range** type field enables users to define a range between two specific dates and times.
Enter a starting time (Start) by simply clicking the clock-button :clock9: at the first section. By clicking
the clock-button :clock9: in the next section (Stop) a time interval (Duration) will be calculated. You can use this
interval or at one manually. Please note that for layout reasons, this field always has its own row.
