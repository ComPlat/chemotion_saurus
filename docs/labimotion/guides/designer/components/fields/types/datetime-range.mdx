A **Datetime Range** type field enables users to define a range between two specific dates and times.
Enter a starting time by simply clicking the clock-button :clock9: at the first section. By clicking
the clock-button :clock9: in the next section a time interval will be calculated. You can use this
interval or at one manually. This field always needs its own row.
