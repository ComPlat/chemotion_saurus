A **Select** type field offers users a dropdown menu with a curated list of predefined options. End-users can conveniently choose from this list, which consists of custom-defined values.

The **Select** field can be used as a restrictive field. Therefore, the values for the restriction need to be entered as the names of the corresponding option(s).

:::

To set up a **Select** field, follow these steps:

1. (optional) Create a `Select List` you need.

   Click on `Add new select list` :heavy_plus_sign: button located on the right side of the [Work Area](../../../template-features/workarea.mdx) to create a new option list you need. Then, enter the desired options into the `Input new option` field and click the :heavy_plus_sign: button to add them to the list. You can change the display text to better suit end users. To remove the option, simply click the <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTrashCan} /> button next to it.

   You can create multiple Select Lists and use them in all layers of the element.

2. Choose the `Select Lists` that you want this **Select** field represent.

   In the `Options` field, select the `Select List` you created in the previous step.
