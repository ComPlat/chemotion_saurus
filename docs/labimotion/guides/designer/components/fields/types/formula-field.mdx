A **Formula-Field** type field is used to perform calculations based on specified inputs.

:::info

When setting up the calculation formula, use the [Field Name](../../fields#field-name) if you want to use the [Integer](integer) type field.

## Extra Field Attributes

### Decimal

The decimal of the calculation result.

### Can adjust?

When this is checked, it means that the user is allowed to change the calculation result.

### Formula

The calculation formula.

For example:

- Field A: Field Name - field_a, Type - Integer
- Field B: Field Name - field_b, Type - Integer
- Field C: Field Name - field_c, Type - Formula-Field

Let's set up the formula: (field_a + field_b) / 0.33

When an end-user enters "330" in Field A and "30" in Field B, the formula calculation (330 + 30) / 0.33 will be displayed in Field C.

Watch the video below to see how easy it is to perform sorting and filtering tasks in a list.
