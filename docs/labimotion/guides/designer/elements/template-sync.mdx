Effortlessly synchronize templates suitable for your application from the Template Hub, enabling you to harness the collaborative contributions of scientists. This approach is highly recommended.

As a [Designer](/docs/labimotion/design-principles#-designer-role), you can sync collective contributed templates from the Template Hub to your instance. This allows users to seamlessly work with the templates and publish their work step-by-step. See [Template Sync. & Publish](../../../template-sync-and-publish).
