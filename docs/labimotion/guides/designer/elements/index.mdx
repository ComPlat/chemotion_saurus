**Element** represents a fundamental building block within the system. It encapsulates specific functions and features to suit your application according to your design.

## User Interface

### Element Template List

The Element templates are conveniently displayed in a grid layout. You can:

- :white_check_mark: **Sort** the grid by clicking on the column headers.
- :white_check_mark: **Filter** the grid by clicking on the filter icon <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faList} size="lg"/> located at the right of the column headers.
