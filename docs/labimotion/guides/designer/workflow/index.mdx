The **Workflow** facilitates the seamless arrangement and organization of different processes within a visual workspace. It offers the following key features:

- **Layer Listing:** The component presents a comprehensive list of available process layers, specifically designated as "[Workflow layers.](components/layers/#used-in-workflow)" These layers represent distinct stages or steps in the workflow.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Users can effortlessly select and move workflow layers from the list to a designated panel. The intuitive drag-and-drop action enables quick and precise placement.
- **Visual Connection:** After positioning the layers within the panel, users can visually connect them using a mouse-driven interface. This process establishes the priority and sequence of the layers within the workflow.

Upon enabling Workflow, an automatic user interface enhancement introduces a "Next" field. This field dynamically lists all possible steps or stages for users to select their desired progression route.
