The **Datasets** function shares commonalities with both the [Elements](elements/) and [Segments](segments/) functions, affording you the ability to intricately design the user interface through the integration of [Layers](components/layers/) and [Fields](components/fields/). Notably, the distinctive aspect of the "Datasets" function lies in its association with the Chemical Methods Ontology. To initiate the design of a Dataset, you are required to first select the relevant Ontology. Subsequently, they can seamlessly begin shaping and refining the Dataset's user interface using [Layers](components/layers/) and [Fields](components/fields/), thus offering a specialized and comprehensive approach to interface design tailored to chemical methodologies.

## User Interface

### Dataset Template List

Following the same approach of delivering a user-friendly user interface in a grid format, Dataset templates are displayed in a grid layout for your ease of use.

- :white_check_mark: **Sort** the grid by clicking on the column headers.
- :white_check_mark: **Filter** the grid by clicking on the filter icon <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faList} size="lg"/> located at the right of the column headers.

For a practical demonstration of sorting and filtering tasks in a list, you can watch the video in the [Element Template List](../designer/elements#element-template-list) section.
