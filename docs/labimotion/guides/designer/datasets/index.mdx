Shares commonalities with both the Elements and Segments functions and is
associated with the Chemical Methods Ontology.

The **Datasets** function shares commonalities with both the [Elements](elements/) and [Segments](segments/) functions, affording you the ability to intricately design the user interface through the integration of [Layers](components/layers/) and [Fields](components/fields/). Notably, the distinctive aspect of the "Datasets" function lies in its association with the Chemical Methods Ontology. To initiate the design of a Dataset, you are required to first select the relevant Ontology. Subsequently, they can seamlessly begin shaping and refining the Dataset's user interface using [Layers](components/layers/) and [Fields](components/fields/), thus offering a specialized and comprehensive approach to interface design tailored to chemical methodologies.
