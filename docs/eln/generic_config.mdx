## Generic Segments and Elements

Generic elements and segments are structured according to the different levels **layer** and **field**. Each generic element or segment can contain different, multiple **layers** and each layer can consist of multiple and differnt **fields**. 

![generic feature outline](../../static/img/generic_feature_outline.png)

## Generic Segments

Generic segment can be embedded in different elements, such as sample, reaction...etc., it can also be embedded in generic element.

After clicking on menu item **Generic Segment**, a button <Btn mixed={["New Segment", faPlus]} color={"primary"}/> is shown as default and the segment list is displayed if any data exists. 

![generic_segment_admin](../../static/img/generic_segment_admin.png)

The segment list includes all the segments, and it shows the attribute data and provides further functions, such as “copy”, “edit template” and so on. The segments are sorted  alphabetically by the status (active first), segment label and description.

![generic_segment_list_tip](../../static/img/generic_segment_list_tips.png)

| symbol | explanation |
|---|---|
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faClone} size="lg"/> | to duplicate the segment |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPenSquare} size="lg"/> | to edit segment attributes |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFileAlt} size="lg"/> | to edit segment template |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFileCode} size="lg"/> | to edit segment template in json format |

### create

You can create as many segments as possible for an element, e.g., sample, reaction, or any generic element. Please note, once the segment is created, it can not be re-assigned to another element.

To create a segment, press the button <Btn mixed={[" New Segment ", faPlus]} color={"primary"}/>, fill in the data of segment attributes, and then press <Btn mixed={["Create", faSave]} color={"primary"}/> to save the data into database or <Btn mixed={["Cancel"]} color={"warning"}/> to cancel the operation.

the definition of each attributes:

| attribute | required | explanation |
|---|:---:|---|
| Segment Label | Yes | the name used to display on the UI tab |
| Description | No | used to describe the segment and shown as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the UI tab |
| Assign to Element | Yes | define which element this segment belongs to |

## Generic Elements
Chemotion ELN contains five original elements which are the samples, reactions, wellplates, screens, and research plans. However, other generic elements can be added as needed by the administration.
<img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/create_element.gif"} alt={"Create generic element"}/>
     
For an admin to create a new generic element, go to the page **Generic Elements** and press <Btn mixed={["New Element", faPlus]} color={"primary"}/>. This opens the window **New Element** to enter the attributes of your new generic element. Those attributes are shown in the next table:

###  attributes 

| attribute | required | explanation |
|---|:---:|---|
| Klass | Yes | The name used to identify the element in the system |
| Prefix | Yes | A prefix for naming the generated objects that belong to the generic element, e.g., if the user name abbreviation is "user" and the **Prefix** is "t", then generating new "Mixture" objects will lead to the following names: "user-t1 New Mixture", "user-t2 New Mixture", etc |
| Label | Yes | the name displayed in the UI, e.g., the labels **Sample**, **Reaction**, **Wellplate** |
| Icon | Yes | The icon to be displayed in the elements list and in the toolbar for creating new objects. Icons can be obtained from [Font Awesome 4]( https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/icons/) | 
| Description | No | Explanation of the intended functionality of the element |

When all the required attributes are provided, press <Btn mixed={["Create", faSave]} color={"primary"}/> to create the element, or cancel the process with <Btn mixed={["Cancel"]} color={"warning"}/>. 

<img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/show_element.gif"} alt={"Create generic element"}/>

After an element is created, it can either be added to the ELN interfaces of all the users , or only to specific users. This option is also controlled by the administration.  For the users that can access the element, they have to add it manually to their accounts. To do so, they have to go to their **Account & Profile**, and go to the **Element Counter**,  and update the counter of the specific element with with <Btn mixed={["Update counter"]} color={"primary"}/>. Still, the element will be hidden by default, and it will not appear in the element bar unless the user manually adds them.

In the administration account, in the **Generic Elements** page, after an element is created, it appears in the elements list (not to be confused with the elements list in the ELN).  The elements list includes all the elements generated by the admin’s account, and it shows the attribute data and provides further functions. The elements are sorted alphabetically by the status (active first), element label and description.

<img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/elements_list.png"} alt={"Elements list"}/>

| symbol | explanation |
|---|---|
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faClone} size="lg"/> | to copy the attributes of an element |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPenSquare} size="lg"/> | to edit element attributes, delete the element or deactivate it |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFileAlt} size="lg"/> | to edit element template |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFileCode} size="lg"/> | to edit element template in json format |
                                                                                  
Choosing to edit the element's template enables adding new layers and lists to the **Properties** tab of the element. More on that in the next chapter.


## Layers

**Layers** are the fundamental building block that contains the content of generic elements/segments/datasets. They enable organization of the fields related to a certain topic into groups, along with their layout and appearance. **Layers** can be added to elements and segments by clicking on **edit element/segment template** <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFileAlt} size="lg"/> in the elements/segments list, and then clicking <Btn mixed={["Add new layer", faPlus]} color={"secondary"}/>.

<img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/add_layer.gif"} alt={"Add Layer"}/>

###  attributes 

| attribute | required | explanation |
|---|:---:|---|
| Name | yes | The name used to identify the layer in the system, must be unique in the template |
| Display name | No | The name displayed in the details modal |
| Columns per row | Yes | The maximum number of fields to be aligned in one row (default is 1) |
| Sequential position | No | A number added to sort the layers, if left empty, they are ordered by the order of creation |
| Restriction | No | A number that can set a maximum for certain fields |
| Header color | No | A color for the Display name and its surrounding |
| Style Option | Yes | Styling the Display name, "bold" is the default |

<img src={"/chemotionsaurus/img/add_layer.gif"} alt={"Add Layer"}/>

After a new layer is created, it appears in the layers list, where its Name, Display name, the number of columns per row, and the number of **fields** can be found. A number of buttons allow the following functions:

| symbol | explanation |
|---|---|
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPen} size="lg"/> | to edit the layer's attributes |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTrash} size="lg"/> | to delete the layer |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="lg"/> | to add new fields|
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlusCircle} size="lg"/> | to add dummy fields |

Whenever a new layer is added, or an existing one is edited, changes need to be saved with <Btn mixed={["Save", faSave]} color={"primary"}/>, at this point, if the user that already has access to the element or segment reload the page in their user account, and then press the button <Btn mixed={["Reload"]} color={"danger"}/>,  they will be able to see the new layer.  By having layers, the admins can add fields there. More details on the **Fields** in the next chapter.


## Fields

**Fields** are a wide variety of components with input, display, drag-and-drop functions, depends on the type. Use an appropriate type attribute to take advantage of these UI controls like formula field, system-defined, and more. 

###  attributes 

| attribute | required | explanation |
|---|:---:|---|
| Field Name | Yes | the name given by the admin when first creating the field. It is the name used to identify the field in the system. It must be unique in the template  |
| Display Name | No | the name displayed in the details modal. It has the same value as the "Field Name" by default, but the admin can still modify it or delete it to create a field without a displayed name. |
| Hover Info | No | an explanatory text to be shown when the mouse hovers over the "display name" |
| Type | Yes | to specify the type of the field (more details about it in the next paragraph). Its value is "text" by default, but can be modified by the admin |

###  Field types 

| type | availability | dependencies | explanation |
|---|---|---|---|
| checkbox | v0.9.0+ |---| a checkbox is shown as a small square box to let the user make a binary choice |
| drag molecule | v0.9.0+ |---| an icon with drag-and-drop function to let user to add a molecule into a generic element/segment by drag-and-drop operation; it will display the molecule image after being added successfully |
| drag sample | v0.9.0+ (generic element only) |---| an icon with drag-and-drop function to let the user add a sample into a generic element by drag-and-drop operation; it will display the sample image after adding successfully. It also enables using the exact dragge-and-dropped sample, a split of it, or a copy |
| formula field | v0.9.0+ |---| a calculation field; as an admin, define a formula using other fields, which are supposed to be either "integer" or "System-Defined", and system do the calculation automatically. The result appears in the corresponding field, and it keeps getting updated instantly as long as the values used to calculate it are being updated. When the user finish updating the values, they could press **adjust** <Btn mixed={[faArrowRight]} color={"secondary"}/> to adapt the final result, and they could also edit the final result manually, and give it values that don't correspond to the calculated results. This action doesn't affect the values used to calculate the result |
| input group | v0.9.0+ |---| a group of fields; the fields can be 'label', 'text', or 'number'. 'label' is used for display only, and the user can't modify its default value, while 'text' and 'integer' are used as an input field, but still the admins can give them a default value ar first|
| integer | v0.9.0+ |---| an input field for number entries |
| select | v0.9.0+ |---| a dropdown list to let user to select |
| system-defined | v0.9.0+ |---| an interconvertible unit field; with a numerical input field and a button for unit conversion ([details](#field-type-system-defined)) |
| text | v0.9.0+ |---| an input field to let user to enter a single editable line of text |
| text area | v0.9.0+ |---| an input field with adaptable size to let user to enter multi-line text |
| text formula | v0.9.0+ |---| a combine(display only) field to let user to combine other fields or necessary descriptions together |

###  Field-Type: System-defined 

The field type **System-defined** allows to add values with a unit. Units are assigned to certain standards in the community of the research field but should meet common conventions and definitions. Depending on the unit that is used, different conversions are available.
