# Ontology Administration

To accommodate the diverse needs of different applications, we have introduced the "Load OLS Terms" feature, empowering system administrators to enable or disable ontology terminology within the system.

## Usage

When the instance is installed, the "CHMO" and "RXNO" ontologies are installed by default. To customize the ontology terms in the system, follow these steps:

Note: The system administrator can use "Import OLS Terms" to get the complete and refresh installation from the EMBL-EBI file.

### 1. Select OLS Terms

By clicking the "OLS Terms" option, you can access a dropdown that lists the existing Ontology Terms in the system. After selecting the desired Ontology Terms, the system will automatically load the corresponding terms.

    src={require("@site/static/img/ontology/switch_ontology.webm").default}
  />
</video>

### 2. Switch Mode

The system provides two modes for system administrators to use: "Check Strictly" and "Associated." In "Check Strictly" mode, the system administrator can select a single Ontology Term. In "Associated" mode, the system administrator can choose the Ontology Term, and its associated data will be selected automatically.

### 3. Save

After selecting the desired Ontology Terms, click the "Save" button to save the changes and restart the application.
