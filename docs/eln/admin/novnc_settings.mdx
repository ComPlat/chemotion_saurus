# Access Remote Desktops over VNC using websockify

The concept of our implementation is as follows:

![adminui-vnc](/img/ELN-VNC.png)

For more details of websockify, please see this [repository](https://github.com/novnc/websockify).

Access to the remote can then be given to a user by associating it and the device within a user-group.
Administrators can assign devices and users to existing group (see [Groups & Devices](group_devices)).

User can assign others to the groups they manage (see [My Groups & Devices](group_devices)).
