# Groups and Devices management

![adminui-group](@site/static/img/admin_ui/group.png)

Administrators can assign devices and users to existing groups. The assignment triggers the visibility of a device in the remote control area of the ELN where users can access devices through the ELN UI. The assignment/access to this function is not connected to the retrieval of data from devices.
