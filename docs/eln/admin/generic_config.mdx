## Generic segments, elements and datasets

Generic elements and segments are organized by <b>layers</b> and <b>fields</b>.
Each generic element or segment can contain multiple <b>layers</b> and each layer can consist of multiple <b>fields</b>.

![generic feature outline](/img/generic_feature_outline.png)

## Generic segments

A generic segment can be embedded in other elements, such as samples and reactions, as well as in generic elements.

After clicking on the menu item <b>Generic Segment</b>, you find
a button <Btn mixed={["New Segment", faPlus]} color={"primary"}/>
as well as a list of editable, existing segments.

![generic_segment_admin](/img/generic_segment_admin.png)

The segments can be edited as follows.

![generic_segment_list_tip](/img/generic_segment_list_tips.png)

You can create as many segments as possible for an element,
e.g., sample, reaction, or any generic element.
Once the segment is created, it can not be re-assigned to another element.

To create a segment, press the button <Btn mixed={[" New Segment ", faPlus]} color={"primary"}/>,
fill in the segment attributes, and press <Btn mixed={["Create", faSave]} color={"primary"} />
to save the data or <Btn mixed={["Cancel"]} color={"warning"} /> the creation.

| Description       |    No    | Shown as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the UI tab. |
| Assign to Element |   Yes    | Define which element this segment belongs to.             |

## Generic elements

By default Chemotion ELN contains five elements: samples, reactions, wellplates, screens, and research plans.
Optionally, _generic_ elements can be added by the administration.

<img
  src={require("@site/static/img/create_element.gif").default}
  alt={"Create generic element"}
/>

To create a generic element, go to the page <b>Generic Elements</b> and press <Btn mixed={["New Element", faPlus]} color={"primary"} />.
This opens the window <b>New Element</b> to enter the following attributes:

| attribute   | required | explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | :------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Klass       |   Yes    | The name used to identify the element.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Prefix      |   Yes    | A prefix for naming the generated objects that belong to the generic element, e.g., if the user name abbreviation is "user" and the <b>Prefix</b> is "t", then new "Mixture" will be called: "user-t1 New Mixture", "user-t2 New Mixture", etc.. |
| Label       |   Yes    | The name displayed in the UI, e.g., the labels <b>Sample</b>, <b>Reaction</b>, <b>Wellplate</b>.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Icon        |   Yes    | The icon to be displayed in the elements list and in the toolbar for creating new objects. Icons can be obtained from [Font Awesome 4](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/icons/).                                                                     |
| Description |    No    | Explanation of the intended functionality of the element.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Once all the required attributes are provided, press <Btn mixed={["Create", faSave]} color={"primary"}/> to create the element, or cancel the process with <Btn mixed={["Cancel"]} color={"warning"}/>.

<img
  src={require("@site/static/img/show_element.gif").default}
  alt={"Create generic element"}
/>

After an element is created, it can either be added to the Chemotion ELN interfaces of all users,
or made available to specific users. This option is also controlled by the administration.
Users with access to an element have to add it manually to their accounts.
To do so, they have to go to their <b>Account & Profile</b>, go to the <b>Element Counter</b>,
and update the counter of the element with <Btn mixed={["Update counter"]} color={"primary"}/>.
Still, the element will be hidden by default, and it will not appear in the element bar unless the user manually adds it.

In the administration account, in the <b>Generic Elements</b> page,
the element appears in the elements list (not to be confused with the elements list in the Chemotion ELN).
The elements list includes all the elements generated by the adminâ€™s account,
along with their attributes and further functions.
The elements are sorted alphabetically by status (active first), element label, and description.

| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPenSquare} size="lg"/> | Edit element attributes, delete the element or deactivate it. |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFileAlt} size="lg"/>   | Edit the element template.                                    |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFileCode} size="lg"/>  | Edit the element template in json format.                     |

Editing the element's template allows adding new layers and lists to the <b>Properties</b> tab of the element.
More on that in the next chapter.

## Generic datasets

## Layers

<b>Layers</b> are the fundamental building blocks that contain the content of generic
elements/segments/datasets. They can be used to group related fields with a custom
layout and appearance.
<b>Layers</b> can be added to elements and segments by clicking on <b>
  edit element/segment template
</b> <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFileAlt} size="lg" />
in the elements/segments list, and then clicking <Btn
  mixed={["Add new layer", faPlus]}
  color={"secondary"}
/>
.

<img
  src={require("@site/static/img/add_layer.gif").default}
  alt={"Add Layer"}
/>

The following attributes can be configured on a layer:

| attribute           | required | explanation                                                                            |
| ------------------- | :------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name                |   yes    | The name used to identify the layer, must be unique in the template.                   |
| Display name        |    No    | The name displayed in the details modal.                                               |
| Columns per row     |   Yes    | The maximum number of fields to be aligned in one row (default is 1).                  |
| Sequential position |    No    | A number to sort the layers, if left empty, they are ordered by the order of creation. |
| Restriction         |    No    | A maximum for certain fields.                                                          |
| Header color        |    No    | A color for the Display name.                                                          |
| Style Option        |   Yes    | Style of the Display name, "bold" is the default.                                      |

<img
  src={require("@site/static/img/add_layer.gif").default}
  alt={"Add Layer"}
/>

After a new layer is created, it appears in the layers list, where its Name, Display name,
the number of columns per row, and the number of <b>fields</b> can be found.
Layers can be edited with the following functions:

| symbol                                           | explanation                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPen} size="lg"/>        | Edit the layer's attributes. |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTrash} size="lg"/>      | Delete the layer.            |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="lg"/>       | Add new fields.              |
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlusCircle} size="lg"/> | Add dummy fields.            |

Whenever a new layer is added, or an existing one is edited, changes need to be saved with

<Btn mixed={["Save", faSave]} color={"primary"} />. Once saved, a user with
access to the element or segment will be able to see the new layer upon
reloading the page in their account, and pressing the button <Btn
  mixed={["Reload"]}
  color={"danger"}
/>. Admins can add <b>fields</b> to a layer, as discussed below.

## Fields

<b>Fields</b> provide a wide variety of input, display, and drag-and-drop functions.
They can be customized using the following attributes.

| attribute    | required | explanation                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Field Name   |   Yes    | The name given by the admin when first creating the field. It is the name used to identify the field in the system. It must be unique in the template.                              |
| Display Name |    No    | The name displayed in the details modal. It has the same value as the `Field Name` by default, but the admin can modify it or delete it to create a field without a displayed name. |
| Hover Info   |    No    | An explanatory text to be shown when the mouse hovers over the `Display Name`.                                                                                                      |
| Type         |   Yes    | The type of the field (more details about it in the next paragraph). Its value is "text" by default, but can be modified by the admin.                                              |

### Field-type: System-defined

The field type <b>System-defined</b> allows to add values with a unit.
Units are assigned to certain standards in the research field but should meet common conventions and definitions.
Depending on the unit, different conversions are available.

| unit name                      | unit default | interconversion 1 | interconversion 2 | interconversion 3 | interconversion 4 |
