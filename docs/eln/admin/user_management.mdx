## (De-)activating vs (Un-)locking an account

![adminui-usermanagement-lock-activate](@site/static/img/admin_ui/admin_ui-user_management-lock-activate.png)

A user account is locked automatically after too many failed login attempts (5 successive failed attempts).
The account will be automatically unlock after 10 mins.
Alternately an Admin can unlock it from this interface.

An account can be frozen by deactivating it here. Login to this account is then not possible.
__The user cannot reactivate it. Only an Admin can.__
If the user is currently logged-in, its session will be invalidated.
The data shared by the user to other users is still accessible to them.
