Throughout the ELN, users work with text editors in many different contexts.
Text template are meant to help users with writing by providing ready-made paragraphs that can be inserted in any text editor.
Users can insert a predefined text block by clicking on the corresponding icon on top of the text editors.
For the text-editor of an Analysis section, or a Reaction-description, this Menu-bar can be customized by the user.
The available text templates the user can chose from are managed by the Admin as described here.


Click on `Text Templates` in the sidebar of the administrator interface in order to
open an editor that lets you configure custom text template:

![text_template_editor](/img/admin_ui/text_template_editor.png)

Click on the <Btn mixed={[faPlus]} color={"primary"}/> button to generate a new `text template` and name it appropriately.
Then set the icon (from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/),[Bootstrap glyphicons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/) or internal chemotion eln icon libraries), the `Text` title, and the paragraph that is meant to be added to the users' text.

Icon examples:
- a thermoter icon: "fa fa-thermometer-quarter"
- an asterisk: "glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"

The icon will appear if the entry is added directly in the header of the editor, the text, when the entry is added in a user-defined dropdown menu.

Remove a template by clicking the <Btn mixed={[faTrashAlt]} color={"danger"}/> button next to a template in the list on the left.
