Throughout the ELN, users work with text editors in many different contexts.
`Text templates` are meant to help users with writing by providing ready-made paragraphs that can be inserted in any text editor.
Users can insert a `text template` by clicking on the corresponding icon on top of the text editors.

Click on `Text Templates` in the sidebar of the administrator interface in order to
open an editor that lets you configure custom `text templates`:

![text_template_editor](/img/admin_ui/text_template_editor.png)

Click on the <Btn mixed={[faPlus]} color={"primary"}/> button to generate a new `text template`.
You can then configure an icon ([Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/),[Bootstrap glyphicons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/) or internal chemotion eln icons), a `Text` , as well as a the paragraph that's meant to appear as a template in the users' text editors.

The icon will appear in the header of the editor, the text entry in a user definable dropdown menu.

![text_template_edited](/img/admin_ui/text_template_edited.png)

Remove a `text template` by clicking the <Btn mixed={[faTrashAlt]} color={"danger"}/> button next to a template in the list on the left.
