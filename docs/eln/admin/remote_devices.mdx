# Managing Remote Devices

Administrators can assign devices and users to existing [groups](groups). The assignment triggers the visibility of a device in the remote control area of the ELN where users can access devices through the ELN UI. The assignment/access to this function is not connected to the retrieval of data from devices.

### Access Permissions
Access to the remote can then be given to a user by associating it and the device within a user-group.

Administrators can assign devices and users to existing group.

User can assign others to the groups they manage.
