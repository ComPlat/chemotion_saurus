# Accessing Remote Devices

Remote devices can be accessed for two reasons:

- Accessing their data remotely
- Controlling them remotely

Administrators can `Add new device`s and assign them to existing users (or [groups](groups) of users) for management.

## Accessing Remote Data

This is enabled by collecting `Data Collector` section of a Device's settings panel.

This feature is covered in extended detail in the [Devices](../devices) section.

## Controlling devices remotely

The ELN allows users to control a device remotely using a websockify/noVNC connection. This can be configured in the `noVNC settings` section of a Device's settings panel.

Once a device is configured, access to the remote device can be given to a user (group). This triggers the visibility of a device in the remote control area of the ELN where users can access devices through the ELN UI. 

### VNC using Websockify

The concept of our implementation is as follows:
