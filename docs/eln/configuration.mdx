cp config/user_props.yml.example config/user_props.yml

# edit it
vim config/user_props.yml

# restart the application (assuming Passenger is being used)
touch tmp/restart.txt

# keep the configuration for future Chemotion ELN updates (assuming Capistrano is used)
mv config/user_props.yml /var/www/chemotion_ELN/shared/config/user_props.yml

## File collector 

This is an optional service to collect data files and distribute them to the Chemotion ELN inbox of the respective users.

(see the [devices overview](devices) or [doi: 10.1016/j.acax.2019.100007 ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acax.2019.100007 ))

Two options are available:
- collecting attachment files from e-mails
- collecting file or folder from local drives or over scp

### e-mail-attachement collection 

The Chemotion ELN-app should be given access to an e-mail account in which it will regularly check for incoming e-mails and collect the attachments.
The attachments are then distributed to Chemotion ELN user by matching the additional addressee present in the __To:__ or __CC:__ fied of the e-mail. The sender's e-mail address should also one of an Chemotion ELN-registered device. 

:::danger 
All new incoming e-mails are processed and discarded. 
If the sender and other addresssees are unknown to the Chemotion ELN (e-mails registered to Chemotion ELN accounts), then the e-mail will be directly deleted.
:::


### File collection

Files can be collected from remote storages and distributed to specific user based on the file-name matching the user's name abbreviation.

:::danger 
The directories watched by the collector service will be emptied at each collection i. e. all files within the watched directories will be removed.
:::


### Data-collector settings

Configure the frequency for collecting the files, as well as the e-mail access in the `config/datacollectors.yml` file.
The background worker will collect the files at the frequencies set.
If login credentials are needed, those are set in the configuration file as well.

```sh
### example of configdatacollector.yml 
production:
  :services:
    - :name: 'mailcollector'
      :cron: '5,20,35,50 * * * *' # every 15 minutes starting a xx:05
    - :name: 'folderwatchersftp'
      :every: 5 # minutes
      :watcher_sleep: 30 # seconds
    - :name: 'folderwatcherlocal'
      :every: 5 # minutes
      :watcher_sleep: 30 # seconds
    - :name: 'filewatchersftp'
      :every: 2 # minutes
    - :name: 'filewatcherlocal'
      :every: 2 # minutes

  ## Chemotion ELN e-mail account
  :mailcollector:
    :server: 'imap.server.de'
    :mail_address: "service@mail"
    :password: "password"
    # :port: 993 default
    # :ssl: true default
    :aliases:
      - 'alias_one@kit.edu'
      - 'alias_two@kit.edu'
  
  ## File collection over ssh with password 
  :sftpusers:
    - :user: 'user1'
      :password: 'pass'
    - :user: 'user2'
      :password: 'pass'

  # Dir of ssh keys for data collection over sftp
  :keydir: 'config/data_collector_keys'

  # Allowlist of dir paths for local data collection
  :localcollectors:
    - :path: '<%= Rails.root.join(*%w[tmp datacollector]).to_s %>'
```

:::info NB
After editing the datacollectors.yml the worker service (DelayedJob) needs to be restarted.
:::

For each registered Device, a collection job can be set up through the administrator interface:

## Dynamic Welcome e-mail and Message (optional)

:::caution
This feature is still in Beta version.
:::

This configuration enables sending a welcome message as an e-mail to the new users upon registration. It also displays the same content as a welcome message at the home page. The content is dynamic and can be modified and updated anytime.

![adminui-welcomemessage](../../static/img/adminui-welcomemessage.PNG)

The message is rendered via .md file, you can find the sample file [here.](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/development-5/public/welcome-message-sample.md)
In order to configure this, you just need to create a similar file as above in the same `public` directory named as `welcome-message.md`. You can copy the content from the sample file and modify the message as you wish.

:::note
Restarting of server might be required if you are adding the file to an already running instance.
