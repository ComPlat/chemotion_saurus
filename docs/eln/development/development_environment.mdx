## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you are familiar with the basics of Git, Docker and a Linux operating system.
Have a look at our [learning resources](learning_resources.mdx).

## Introduction

Containers enable isolated, consistent, and portable development environments.
When using containers for development you will not have to install and configure the Chemotion ELN locally on your machine.
Instead, dependencies and configurations are maintained in container-images which you run on your machine using Docker.
This keeps your machine free of clutter, and more importantly,
it can ensure consistent development environments across contributors (i.e., avoiding "works on my machine" scenarios).

In the following you find guides for setting up a dockerized development environment for the Chemotion ELN on
[Windows](#windows-heading-id), [Linux](#linux-heading-id), and [macOS](#macos-heading-id).

## Windows {#windows-heading-id}

:::important Call to action
The following instructions are tested on Windows 10 only.
If you're on Windows 11, please consider contributing your experiences.

This guide will help you getting started developing with containers on Windows using `Docker Desktop` along with the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (referred to as `WSL` in the following).
With `Docker Desktop` you can work in a Linux-based development environment and run Linux-based containers while using an IDE on Windows (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

### Dependencies

#### WSL

Start by [installing `WSL`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

:::important
While going through the `WSL` installation, make sure to install `WSL 2`, not `WSL 1`. Also, make sure to install `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` (referred to as `Ubuntu` in the following) as your Linux distribution. You may need to upgrade `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` from `WSL 1` to `WSL 2`. To check if you have the correct version, open powershell and enter the command

```
wsl.exe -l -v
```

If this shows version 1 for `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` upgrade to `WSL 2` with the command

```
wsl.exe --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2
```

:::

Next, [open an `Ubuntu` terminal](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/a-guide-to-invoking-wsl/#comments) and [set up a user account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password).

#### Docker Desktop

Once you have set up `WSL` you can [install `Docker Desktop` and enable the `WSL` backend in `Docker Desktop`](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/).
For additional information and prerequisites regarding the installation of `Docker Desktop` also have a look [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) (the instructions above should be sufficient though).

### Setup

Once you have `WSL` and `Docker Desktop` installed, you can start setting up the Chemotion ELN development environment.

Make sure that all files you'll download in the following steps live in the Linux file system, *not* in your Windows file system ([here's why](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/#best-practices)).
The Windows file system (e.g., C: drive) is mounted into `Ubuntu` under `/mnt`. Therefore, store your files somewhere else than `/mnt`. For example,
you could store them in your home directory (`~`).

Also, make sure that you're running all commands from a `WSL` terminal (`$` command prompt), i.e., from within `Ubuntu`, not Windows PowerShell (`>` command prompt).
You won't be able to run bash scripts from PowerShell.

On your Windows machine, [open the `Ubuntu` terminal](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/a-guide-to-invoking-wsl/#comments).
Next, start `Docker Desktop`. You can confirm that `Docker Desktop` is running by typing `docker --version` in the `Ubuntu` terminal.
If you get a response you're now ready to run the ELN in a [Docker container](#eln-in-docker) (any IDE) or in a [Visual Studio Code devcontainer](#eln-in-devcontainer) (recommended!).

## Linux {#linux-heading-id}

We assume that you're on a fresh installation of a Linux operating system, either on a physical or virtual machine.
The instructions have been tested on 64-bit Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS) and 22.04 (LTS).

### Dependencies

#### Docker Engine

Install Docker Engine according to <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository>,
and make sure that non-root users can issue Docker commands: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user>.

You're now ready to run the ELN in a [Docker container](#eln-in-docker) (any IDE) or in a [Visual Studio Code devcontainer](#eln-in-devcontainer) (recommended!).

## macOS {#macos-heading-id}

:::important Call to action
We haven't extensively tested our containerized development environment on macOS.
If you're on macOS, please consider contributing your experiences.
You can propose additions / changes to this documentation by opening a pull request on
<https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus>. Thank you!
:::

Install Docker (<https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/>)
and run the ELN in a [Docker container](#eln-in-docker) (any IDE)
or in a [Visual Studio Code devcontainer](#eln-in-devcontainer) (recommended!).

Alternatively, we recommend setting up a Ubuntu virtual machine and following the [Linux installation](#linux-heading-id).

## ELN in a Docker container {#eln-in-docker}

:::caution operating system requirements
Make sure you've followed the instructions for your operating system ([Windows](#windows-heading-id), [Linux](#linux-heading-id), [macOS](#macos-heading-id)).
:::

Start by cloning <https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN>.
The repository contains the ELN's source code and Docker configuration (`docker-compose.dev.yml`).

From the root of the repository (i.e., `pwd` is `chemotion_ELN`),
you can instantiate the development environment with

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

The previous command starts and orchestrates three containers:

1. An "app" container with a runtime environment for the ELN
2. A "postgres" container with the ELN's database
3. A "webpacker" server

Docker will give each of these containers a unique name that you can query with

```shell
docker ps
```

You can open an interactive bash shell in the "app" container...

```shell
docker exec -it <NAME_OF_APP_CONTAINER_FROM_DOCKER_PS> /bin/bash
```

...and issue commands inside the container, e.g., to set up the database...

```shell
bundle exec rake db:setup
```

...or run tests.

```shell
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rspec
```

To stop the development environment (i.e., shut down all three containers) run

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

## ELN in a Visual Studio Code devcontainer {#eln-in-devcontainer}

:::caution operating system requirements
Make sure you've followed the instructions for your operating system ([Windows](#windows-heading-id), [Linux](#linux-heading-id), [macOS](#macos-heading-id)).
:::

:::caution Windows Docker Desktop
If you're using Docker Desktop (opposed to the Docker Engine on Linux)
make sure that Docker Desktop is running before starting the devcontainer.
:::

Visual Studio Code devcontainers allow you to run your entire development environment inside a Docker container.
For more context visit <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers>.

### Dependencies

#### Visual Studio Code

Install Visual Studio Code (referred to as `VSCode` in the following) on you operating system: <https://code.visualstudio.com>.
Note that if you're on Windows, please install VSCode on Windows, not on the Ubuntu system that's running under WSL.

Once you've got VSCode running, install the `Dev Containers` extension (ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):
<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers>.

### Setup

Start by cloning <https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN>.
The repository contains the ELN's source code as well as the configuration for the devcontainer (`.devcontainer/`).

Start VSCode from the root of the repository (i.e., `pwd` is `chemotion_ELN`), by running

```shell
code .
```

The VSCode IDE is now running on you host operating system.
You can open the IDE inside a running Docker container as follows.
Bring up the Command Pallet with `Ctrl+Shift+P`, and type `>Dev Containers:`.
VSCode will list all available commands for the `Dev Containers` extension.
Select `>Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`. Based on the configuration in the repositories
`.devcontainer` directory, VSCode will now build and orchestrate the containers that constitute the
development environment. This could take about an hour, depending on your system's resources.

## Troubleshooting

Below are a few remedies you can try when you're having trouble setting up your containerized
development environment.

### Clean Docker

Make sure that you're working with a clean Docker system: <https://docs.docker.com/config/pruning/>.

### Remove `node_modules` directory

The ELN "app" container (`Dockerfile.chemotion-dev`) is configured such that the `node_modules` directory
is kept outside of the ELN repository.
Some commands (especially when you're using `npm` instead of `yarn`) will populate
the `node_modules` directory inside the ELN repository, which can cause trouble.
Simply remove `node_modules` from the repository in that case. Similarly, it can help to remove

* `public/packs`
* `public/packs-test`
* `tmp/cache/*`

### Use `yarn` not `npm` to handle JavaScript dependencies

### When you are hopelessly stuck: start over

Use the fact that everything is containerized to your full advantage.
If you feel like you've painted yourself into a corner, simply start over.
It's much easier to set up everything from scratch when using containers,
opposed to re-installing a clean development environment on your local machine.

### Ask around

Chances are someone on the team was stuck on a similar, if not the same, problem before and knows
how to help you out.
