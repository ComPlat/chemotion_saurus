Welcome to the development documentation of the Chemotion ELN.

## Repositories

* Source code: <https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_eln>
* Documentation: <https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus>

## Setting up a development environment

We recommend setting up a development environment in a Visual Studio Code devcontainer.
You can find more information [here](development_environment.mdx).

## Learning resources

To learn more about the technologies we're using on the project, have a look at the following
[resources](learning_resources.mdx).

## Technologies

The project is built with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), version 6.1.
It uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
However, this project differs from a typical Rails project:

* It is using a JSON API.
* Rails comes with built-in support for an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database, but the project is using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
* The front-end is built using the [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [alt](http://alt.js.org) frameworks. The main page is a single-page application (SPA) along with a few other pages.

## Directory structure

### app

**app** is the main directory in a Rails application. It contains the MVC structure in the subdirectories **models**, **views**, and **controllers**.
However, because the project doesn't adhere to the default Rails architecture, the controllers are mostly empty.
Instead of controllers, a JSON API is used which lives in the **api** directory. Also, there are not many pages in the views directory.

The assets are compiled with [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker).
There are currently multiple directories containing **assets** (e.g., under `app`, `public`, `vendor`, `tmp`).
The **app/assets** directory was the main directory for storing assets in the previous version with Rails 4.
With the implementation of Webpacker the assets moved to **app/packs**.
For example, the JavaScript files with all React components formerly lived in `app/assets/javascripts` and now moved to `app/packs/src`.
`app/packs/src` contains a directory for each single-page application (SPA). For example, the user-facing SPA lives in is the `app/packs/src/components`.
The **stylesheets** directory is still located under `app/assets`.

### config

Contains the configuration of the application. For example, **database.yml** contains the configuration of the database.
The **environments** subdirectory contains the three environments provided by Rails by default (i.e., **development**, **production**, and **test**).
The **initializers** subdirectory contains the configuration of extensions.
For instance, in the **devise** subdirectory, we configure a [package](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) for authentication which takes care of the mail sender and passwords.

### lib

Modules related to the application are added to this directory, such as PubChem, DataCite, OpenBabel. It also has the **storage** directory where the files are uploaded.

### node_modules

Contains [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) modules which are installed with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### public

Contains static files, such as **images** of molecules. It is difficult to query them as they have hexadecimal identifiers.
When creating, e.g., a new reaction, the application will create an image for it and store it in the **images**/**reactions** directory.

### spec

Contains Ruby and JavaScript unit test, as well as feature/acceptance tests.

### uploads

Contains attachments uploaded by the user.

### .rubocop.yml and .eslintrc

**.eslintrc** and **.rubocop.yml** contain the linter configurations for JavaScript and Ruby respectively.
Visit the [linting chapter](linting) for more details.
