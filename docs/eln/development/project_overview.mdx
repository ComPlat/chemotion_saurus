:::info Info
This page is still being edited and reviewed.
:::

Both the native and Docker installation for development will result in cloning the source code (or a fork of it) of the Chemotion ELN project.
The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_eln).
The images in this chapter are from the [Docker installation](../dev_docker_install.mdx).

The project is built with the [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) framework in version 5.
It uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
However, this project differs from a typical Rails project:
- It is using a JSON API.
- Rails comes with built-in support for [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), but the project is using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). [Redis](https://redis.io/) might be used in the future as well.
- The front-end is built using the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework. The main page is a single-page application (SPA) along with a few other pages.

# Directory structure

## app
<b>app</b> is the main directory in a Rails application. It contains the MVC structure in the subdirectories <b>models</b>, <b>views</b>, and <b>controllers</b>.
However, because the project doesn't adhere to the default Rails architecture, the controllers are mostly empty.
Instead of controllers, a JSON API is used which lives in the <b>api</b> directory. Also, there are not many pages in the views directory.

Since we upgraded from Rails 4 to 5, assets are compiled with <Link to="https://github.com/rails/webpacker">Webpacker</Link> in addition to (or in the future replacement of)
the <Link to="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Rails Asset Pipeline</Link>.
There are currently multiple directories containing <b>assets</b> (e.g., under `app`, `public`, `vendor`, `tmp`).
The <b>app/assets</b> directory was the main directory for storing assets in the previous version with Rails 4.
With the implementation of Webpacker the assets moved to <b>app/packs</b>.
For example, the JavaScript files with all React components formerly lived in `app/assets/javascripts` and now moved to `app/packs/src`.
`app/packs/src` contains a directory for each single-page application (SPA). For example, the user-facing SPA lives in is the `app/packs/src/components`.
The <b>stylesheets</b> directory is still located under `app/assets`.

## config
Contains the configuration of the application. For example, <b>database.yml</b> contains the configuration of the database.
The <b>environments</b> subdirectory contains the three environments provided by Rails by default (i.e., <b>development</b>, <b>production</b>, and <b>test</b>).
The <b>initializers</b> subdirectory contains the configuration of extensions.
For instance, in the <b>devise</b> subdirectory, we configure a [package](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) for authentication which takes care of the mail sender and passwords.

## lib
Modules related to the application are added to this directory, such as PubChem, DataCite, OpenBabel. It also has the <b>storage</b> directory where the files are uploaded.

## node_modules
Contains [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) modules which are installed with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

## public
Contains static files, such as <b>images</b> of molecules. Iit is difficult to query them as they have hexadecimal identifiers.
When creating, e.g., a new reaction, the application will create an image for it and store it in the <b>images</b>/<b>reactions</b> directory.

## spec
Contains unit test, acceptance test, and JavaScript test.

## uploads
Contains attachments uploaded by the user.

## .rubocop.yml and .eslintrc
It is advised to use RuboCop and ESLint for Ruby and JavaScript code respectively.
The hidden files <b>.eslintrc</b> and <b>.rubocop.yml</b> contain the linter configurations.
Look at the [development chapter](development#linting) for more details.
