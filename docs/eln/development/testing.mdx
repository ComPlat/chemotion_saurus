We test the Chemotion ELN using three different kinds of tests.

#### 1. JavaScript unit tests (mocha)
     npm test 
#### 2. Ruby unit tests (rpec)
    RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:test:prepare && bundle exec rspec exclude-pattern spec/features/**/*_spec.rb
#### 3. Acceptance (feature) tests (Capybara)
    RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:test:prepare && bundle exec rake assets:precompile && bundle exec rspec spec/features


## General rules of thumb
- All public methods should be tested, every statement, conditional branch should be covered
- Tests should be easy to read and understand. Try to use a maximum of 3 of describe/context levels
    - **Describe**: what is the class/method i want to test
    - **Context**: under what circumstances is the method tested
    - **It**: what do i expect
- Testing the UI should not be in focus for unit tests. Exception is snaphot testing in js
- Useful resources

    - https://rspec.info/
## Javascript Unit tests
- Tests should be placed in **spec/javascript/...** . Mirroring the location of the src file.
- Tests should have the name of the original file but end with **.spec.js**
- For simple plain js objects test every "public" method. By not having access modifiers one should look what methods are called by other components
### Testing a react components
- using the Enzyme library to create react components: `wrapper = shallow(<CLASS_OF_COMPONENT/>);`    
- react components can be used with its js-state or its html representation: `wrapper.instance()` and `wrapper.html()` 
- Example: [ResearchPlanDetailsFieldImage.spec.js](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/applying-gem-shrine-2/spec/javascripts/packs/src/apps/mydb/elements/details/researchPlans/ResearchPlanDetailsFieldImage.spec.js)

:::caution Warning
Testing a component which includes a store need an explicit import of the store in the test file. The import must be before the import statement of the component to test.
The linter recognize that the store dependency is not used and tries to eliminate it. By manually disabling the linter rule for those line, one can prevent it.
Example: [ResearchPlanDetails.spec.js](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/applying-gem-shrine-2/spec/javascripts/packs/src/apps/mydb/elements/details/researchPlans/ResearchPlanDetails.spec.js)
:::

### Stubbing/Mocking

- Heavy dependencies like REST calls can be stubbed/mocked in a test
- We use the library sinon  
 `Sinon.stub(CLASS_TO_MOCK, "METHOD_NAME").callsFake(LAMBDA as replacement of original method);` 
- Example: [ResearchPlanDetailsFieldImage.spec.js](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/applying-gem-shrine-2/spec/javascripts/packs/src/apps/mydb/elements/details/researchPlans/ResearchPlanDetailsFieldImage.spec.js#L54)

### Creating models by factories
- To create model objects we use the library [factory-bot](https://github.com/ratson/factory-bot)
- `const researchPlan = await ResearchPlanFactory.build('empty');`
- By using a pseudoRandomGenerator in the factory for ids and checksums we can create reproducible objects
- One can reset the generator by adding a build option: `const researchPlan = await ResearchPlanFactory.build('empty', {}, { reset: true });`
:::caution Warning
Creating a model is an asynchronous action, so the test must also be asynchronous: `it('no img tag should be rendered', async function (){ }`
:::

### Snapshot testing
- By testing a react component, one should test the state of the component. An easy way would be to check if the html state is correct.
- By using the snapshot library [expect-mocha-snapshot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expect-mocha-snapshot) a snapshot of the html state is generated at the first test run. After that the state in the test is checked against the saved state from the first run.
- Snapshots are saved in a folder __snapshots__ at the same level of the test
- Snapshots are not only restricted to html but can also be used for json or js-objects
- Example: [ResearchPlanDetailsFieldImage.spec.js](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/applying-gem-shrine/spec/javascripts/packs/src/apps/mydb/elements/details/researchPlans/ResearchPlanDetailsFieldImage.spec.js#L52)

:::caution Warning
The expect extension by mocha refers to the current test-object by `this`. Using an lambda expression at the it definition, mocha have no access to it. Using an explicit
function definition solved this problem.
:::

## Ruby Unit tests

### common infos
- Tests should reflect the structure of the src package. That means having exact the same location and name ending with and *_spec.rb. 
- [Example test](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/development-5/spec/api/chemotion/attachment_api_spec.rb)

### creating db models via factory bot

- Models can be created using the library [factory bot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot). In factories, desired states of the models are predefined and can then be created using create (creates a DB entry) or build (creates a model without a DB entry).
:::caution Warning
Creating an attachment via factorybot must be handled carefully because `create` also triggers the `create_derivative` method and could remove a fixture file. By using `build` the `create_derivative` method is not executed, but one has no object in DB and some properties are not initialized.
:::

### Testing methods without classes
- can be done by  by adding type :helpers  `Rspec.describe GenericHelpers, type: :helper do`.  
 Example [generic_helpers_spec.rb](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/applying-gem-shrine/spec/api/helpers/generic_helpers_spec.rb)

### Stubbing/Mocking
- REST calls  
 `stub_request(REST_METHOD_AS_SYMBOL, 'REST_ADDRESS'`   
      `  .with(REQUEST_HEADER_INFOS OR/AND PARAMETER)`    
      `  .to_return(RETURN BODY OR/AND HEADER)`         
Example: [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/applying-gem-shrine/spec/spec_helper.rb#L86)
:::info Info
Many REST requests especially requesting INCHI keys are already defined in  [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/applying-gem-shrine/spec/spec_helper.rb#L86)
:::
 
- Methods of classes/objects  
`allow_any_instance_of(CLASS_NAME).to receive(METHOD_NAME_AS_SYMBOL).and_return(RESULT)`  
`allow_any_instance_of(CLASS_NAME).to receive(METHOD_NAME_AS_SYMBOL).and_raise(AN ERROR)`

## Acceptance tests

When you have freshly installed Chemotion ELN, make sure to create a `welcome-message.md` file in the public directory inside Chemotion ELN before running acceptance tests. You can create it from the example file:

## Coverage

Infos about code coverage: [Code Coverage](https://www.guru99.com/code-coverage.html)

### JavaScript unit tests

- Using `npm run coverage` creates a coverage report in html written in .coverage. The method of covering is condition coverage.
- in package.json one can exclude directories from coverage 
- Coverage is currently not included in CI
