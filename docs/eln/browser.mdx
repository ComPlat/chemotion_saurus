There are two ways to use the Chemotion ELN:
1. A [test version](https://eln.chemotion.net/home) is available for demonstration purposes and time-limited applications. It is freely available to all interested users. The test version enables you to evaluate the latest version of Chemotion ELN without prior installation with regard to its suitability for your individual application. We ask you not to do any logging via the test version since data may be lost due to system updates and database changes. Some functions cannot be accessed in the test version, e.g. the SciFinder plug-in.

:::info
There is no SciFinder available in the test version.

2. For routine use in operations, Chemotion ELN and Repository can be installed on an institute, group or university server. It is recommended to seek the support of a supervising admin. The installation is described in detail at the end of this manual, but should be carried out by someone with experience in server administration.
