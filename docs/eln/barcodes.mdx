The ELN supports the generation and reading of barcodes and QR codes in two sizes. Both size options were tested with the following printers: 
(1) 

The ELN supports barcodes generated by the ELN. Barcodes generated and defined by other systems are not integrated per default. 
Barcodes are adapted to work with Bruker NMR instruments, other specific devices are not yet implemented. 

Barcodes can be gained for different entities in the ELN: 
- samples
- reactions
- wellplates
- screens

Also, barcodes and QR codes can be gained for each analysis that is registered in the ELN, this should facilitate to differenciate between different samples that are submitted for different measurements.

Printed barcodes, added to a certain flask or tube, can be read by standard readers. Reading the code induces the direct link to the item in the ELN, for that the barcode was generated.
