## System Requirements

The currently suggested minimum configuration is as follows:

- An OS that supports Docker
  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), both of which can be installed along with GUI using the [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) suite.
  - The Docker Daemon may be configured to run as a non-root user (Rootless mode). Please see the distribution-specific [setup instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) for details.
  - Some users have reported success using [Podman](https://podman.io/). However, we currently do not test compatibility with Podman because of resource limitations.
- 4 CPUs ([x64 instruction set](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64))
- 8 GB memory
- 300 GB disk space for OS (Linux preferred), docker and Chemotion ELN
- 100 GB or more disk space for _each_ attached device depending on the attached device(s).
- **Browser**: For the use of the Chemotion ELN (and Repository), Chrome is recommended. Other browsers such as Firefox or Edge only allow limited functionalities in some areas of the application (e.g. collection management and ChemSpectra).

:::caution Recommendation
Please use Chrome as browser for the Chemotion ELN and Repository.

## Ways to Install

- [Using ChemCLI](ChemCLI)
- [Manual install](manual_install)

## After Installation

Please follow the configuration steps (see [here](manual_install#configuring-the-installation) and [here](configuration) to personalize your installation and then perform a [system check](system_check) to make sure that all features are working as intended.

# When to upgrade?

The team behind Chemotion ELN is working hard to introduce new features, bug fixes and security patches. We therefore recommend that you upgrade your ELN instance (at least) once **every three months**. To make it easy for you, most upgrade involve creating a backup (for data safety reasons), replacing a file, stopping the old ELN and starting the new one. This process is further automated if you use [ChemCLI](ChemCLI).

## Chemotion versions released before April 2022

**i.e. versions before ELN v1.1.2**

While we strive to support all instances of Chemotion, the documentation only deals actively with fresh installations and upgrades for ELN versions released in past 12 months. For anything before that, and **particularly for installations that run natively** (i.e. without docker), please get in touch with the [helpdesk](/helpdesk) for more personalized support.
