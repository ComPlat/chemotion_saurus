## Collections: Organization, Function and Usage
### Collection Bar
The collection bar is used to organize the ELN. Some symbols are defined below:

| symbol | meaning |
|---|---|
| <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faList} size="lg"/>  |  Toggle Collections on/of  |
| <Btn icon={faCog} color={"danger"}/> | switch between Collection and Element View |
| <Btn icon={faPlus} color={"success"}/> | open subcollections |
| <Btn icon={faMinus} color={"success"}/> | close subcollections |
| <Btn icon={faShareAlt} color={"secondary"}/> | Your own collections are listed in the collection bar. Collections that you have shared with other researchers (**My shared collections**) or that have been shared with you (**Shared with me**) are also listed. Collections can also be created that are permanently accessible by several users (**Synchronized collections**). |

### Standard Collections All and chemotion.net
Every user will find the two pre-installed collections **All** and **chemotion.net** in their ELN. These are not meant to be removed as they represent an important functionality.

#### `All`: The All collection
In the **All** collection, all elements from the other collections and subcollections are gathered. The **All** collection provides access to all other collections. It is very important if the assignment of an element is accidentally deleted (e.g. **remove**). The collection **All** has been created as a security collection so that an element would still be available and able to be re-assigned if it is no longer associated with a certain collection (this should not actually happen).

:::danger Caution
No action can be performed within the All collection because it is a kind of backup. Please change to your work collections to edit your samples or experiments.

#### `chemotion.net`: The chemotion.net collection
The **chemotion.net** collection enables sorting elements for publishing within Chemotion repository. 

The Collection is pre-installed to make every user aware of the possibility of easily providing their data. The repository can be used to store the data at any time, and these data can be useful to other scientists later on. 

The **chemotion.net** collection should be used when the ELN user wants to make data on samples, reactions or results available to other researchers. Initially, the collection is just a folder that is used for structuring within one's own journal. There is no access to these data from outside. If the journal user is ready to provide their information, then they can share the data from within the **chemotion.net** collection by re-selecting and confirming their release to the repository. If this release is made within the term of a competition (periods are regularly announced on www.chemotion.net), the entries will be registered for the competition.

###  Sorting and Organizing
Creating, sorting, and organizing collections is carried out in collection management (accessible via the collection button <Btn icon={faCog} color={"danger"}/> in the collection bar). A new collection can be generated through collection management. By pressing <Btn icon={faPlus} color={"success"}/>, a new entry **New Collection** is created under **My Collections**. Give your collection a name and save it by pressing **update** <button className="button button--sm button--warning">Update</button>.

:::danger Caution
Without the creation of collections, the use of the ELN is not possible! Remember to **update** <button className="button button--sm button--warning">Update</button>! Without this confirmation, no collection will be generated
