## The First Collection

![Collection View](/img/first_collection.gif) 

A <b>collection</b> is a collection of elements (<b>Sample</b>, <b>Reaction</b>, <b>Wellplate</b>, <b>Screen</b>, <b>Research Plan</b> and others) that is assigned to a project or subproject. Two collections are given per default: <b>chemotion-repository.net</b> and <b>All</b>. The <b>chemotion-repository.net</b> collection is a connector to the chemotion repository and should not be used in the first ELN trials. The collection <b>All</b> is installed as backup, it contains all entries of the ELN independent of other assignments. The creation of the first own collection is usually the first step in the ELN and allows to store own elements.
For the creation of collections please use the collection management via the red button <Btn mixed={[faCog]} color={"danger"}/> in the collection bar. Please create a new entry <b>New Collection</b> under <b>My Collections</b> by pressing <Btn mixed={[faPlus]} color={"success"}/>. Please rename the collection and save it by pressing <Btn mixed={["Update"]} color={"warning"}/>.

:::danger Caution
To use the ELN functions, a first user-defined collection has to be created!
Please think about a smart structure for your ELN and create your first collection!
