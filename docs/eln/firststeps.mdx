## The first Collection

A "collection" is a collection of elements (molecules, reactions, screens, well plates and others) that is assigned to a project or subproject. Two collections are given per default., Chemotion.net and All. The "Chemotion.net" collection is a connector to the chemotion repository and should not be used in the first ELN trials. The collection "All" is installed as backup, it contains all entries of the ELN independent of other assignments. The creation of the first own collection is usually the first step in the ELN and allows to store own elements.
For the creation of collections please use the collection management via the red collection button in the collection bar and create a new entry under My collections by pressing +. Please rename the collection and save it by pressing update.
