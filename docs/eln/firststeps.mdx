## Registration
Registration is a necessary step towards your own laboratory notebook. Please register on your first visit to the electronic laboratory notebook. Then use this access data for each subsequent login. The registration page or the login page will always be the first page accessed. 

## SciFinder Setup
The SciFinder-n module (query information in SciFinder-n by using an API) can be installed following the documentation here: https://www.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/settings#scifindern. To enable the use of the API, your institute needs to have a regular SciFinder-n license. For each ELN instance, a registration at CAS is needed. This is managed by the Chemotion team at KIT to facilitate the process. For requesting a license for SciFinder-n API use in chemotion, please send a short request to the NFDI4Chem helpdesk https://www.nfdi4chem.de/index.php/helpdesk/. We will contact you and clarify the necessary details.


Once the SciFinder module has been installed, user can register the SciFinder crediential in the "Account & Profile".

## The First Collection

![Collection View](/img/first_collection.gif) 

A <b>collection</b> is a collection of elements (<b>Sample</b>, <b>Reaction</b>, <b>Wellplate</b>, <b>Screen</b>, <b>Research Plan</b> and others) that is assigned to a project or subproject. Two collections are given per default: <b>chemotion-repository.net</b> and <b>All</b>. The <b>chemotion-repository.net</b> collection is a connector to the chemotion repository and should not be used in the first Chemotion ELN trials. The collection <b>All</b> is installed as backup, it contains all entries of the Chemotion ELN independent of other assignments. The creation of the first own collection is usually the first step in the Chemotion ELN and allows to store your own elements.
For the creation of collections please use the collection management via the red button <Btn mixed={[faCog]} color={"danger"}/> in the collection bar. Please create a new entry <b>New Collection</b> under <b>My Collections</b> by pressing <Btn mixed={[faPlus]} color={"success"}/>. Please rename the collection and save it by pressing <Btn mixed={["Update"]} color={"warning"}/>.

:::danger Caution
To use the Chemotion ELN functions, a first user-defined collection has to be created!
Please think about a smart structure for your Chemotion ELN and create your first collection!
