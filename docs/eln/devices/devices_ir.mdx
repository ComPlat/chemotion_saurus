In this guideline, we have explained the integration process of the IR device into the Chemotion ELN. This procedure
enables remote access to the PC connected to the device, which runs the software, IR 214 and also the transfer of
the experiment data to the Chemotion ELN’s inbox.

:::

Considering all these aspects, this procedure has been conducted on the following system configurations. However it is
likely to work on systems with different software versions as well.

## Specifications of the IR PC
- Operating system: Windows 10
- Software Name: Opus (Version: 8.7.31)
- Connected to Internet/Intranet: Yes
- Data files generated: DPT files (.dpt)
- Static IP address has been configured

# Objectives
- Remote Device Control
- Data transfer to Chemotion ELN inbox

For the IR device integration, we have decided to configure both these features.

# Configurations
## Remote Device Control

## Data transfer
Data will automatically be transferred to the Chemotion ELN once the data has been saved locally on the computer. The
user only needs to make sure to name the output file according to the
[naming convention](/docs/eln/devices#name-conventions) before saving it to the local machine.

Please take care that you communicate name conventions to all users of the Chemotion ELN:

### Configurations in IR PC
The IR PC and the Chemotion ELN both need access to a common network storage location. This can be set up on a
third-party storage (a NAS server, shared storage of another PC etc.) or it can be set up locally on the IR PC. In this
case, the LSDF storage service from KIT has been used.

We need to download an executable file from the [EFW builder](http://193.196.38.127/) that will run on the computer to
transfer data from a predefined source (local location on the computer) to a destination (LSDF server in this case)
and schedule a task at startup so that the process keeps running on the computer. Details can be found
[here](/eln/devices/device_configuration.mdx).

In this step, we have to restart the PC for the scheduler to run.

### Configurations in Chemotion ELN
The Chemotion ELN’s data collector has to be configured to collect data of the IR device from the network location.

As for the file collector mechanism, there are two options.

- Collecting attachment files from emails
- Collecting file or folder from local drives or over SCP

Here in this guide we have used the second mechanism where the files are collected from remote storage locations and are
distributed to specific users based on the file-name matching the name abbreviation of the user.
