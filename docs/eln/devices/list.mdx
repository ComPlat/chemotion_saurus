### List of devices transfering data to Chemotion ELN

The following list summarizes those devices for that a tranfer routine from the devices to Chemotion ELN was enabled.
For most of the devices, a detailed description of the routine is given in the link (last column of the table). If the
description is missing, we will provide it soon. If you have questions, please don't hesitate to contact us directly. We
are constantly working on the integration of new devices, please let us know if you need support for your favourite
devices.

Possible integration types are **automatic** and **manual**. Automatic means that the full process works automatically.
There are several approaches for the automatic transfer

- transferring data through **email provider**
- **exe** running as a program
- **powershell script** running as a background service
- macro

On the other hand, manual means that the device is not connected to any network and therefore, one manual transfer step is needed. This is
usually solved via a direct regular upload of data collections to the chemotion ELN data exchange server.
