title: Agilent GC/MS ChemStation E.02.01
---

In this guideline, the integration process of an Agilent GC/MS controlled via ChemStation E.02.01 in Windows XP into the Chemotion
ELN is explained. The procedure is split into two aspects that can be set up independently or in parrallel: 1. Remote connection 
to the device and 2. transfer of experiment data to the ELN.

:::info
General preparation aspects can be found [here](../devices#general-preparation-aspects).
:::

Considering all these aspects, this procedure has been conducted on the following system configurations. However it is
likely to work on systems with different software versions as well.

## Specifications of the device's PC

- Operating system: Windows XP
- Software Name: Agilent ChemStation E.02.01
- Connected to LAN (Intranet only): Yes
- Data files generated: ChemStation *.D Folder with multiple files
- Static IP address has been configured

# Objectives

- Remote Device Control
- Data transfer to Chemotion ELN inbox


# Configurations

## Remote Device Control

:::info
General guideline regarding the configurations of remote device control can be found [here](configurations/remote_control).

## Data transfer

Data will automatically be transferred to the Chemotion ELN once ChemStation has finished recording data of the current run. The
user is required to imput a valid file output name according to the [naming convention](../devices#name-conventions) for the Chemotion
ELN to sort the file into the correct user's inbox.

:::info
Please take care that you communicate [name conventions](../devices#name-conventions) to all users of the Chemotion ELN.

### Nescessary configuration in ChemStation

Data transfer is coordinated by a macro configured to be executed as a post-method macro.

The GC/MS computer and Chemotion ELN need access to a common network storage location that is set up as a virtual network drive on the GC/MS computer. 
The network storage can be set up on a third-party storage (a NAS server, shared storage of another PC etc.). In this
case, the LSDF storage service from KIT has been used.

The macro will alert users after running an experiment if the connection to the network location has been lost. This is done by reading a file "connection.txt"
permanently stored on the network location. The file connection.txt does not requre any content.

Creating the macro:

Create a new file in ChemStation's main program folder: *\msdchem\1\macros appropialtely named (example: ELN_Export.mac"), make
sure the file is of the *.mac file type. Open the file, for example using Notepad, and insert the following text, then save and close the file.

name ELN_Export
    Filesize "Z:\connection.txt"
    If size > -1 then
        Copy_DataPath$ + _DataFile$,"Z:\ELN\" + _DataFile$,DONTASK
    Else
        Alert "No connection to the network path; Your data could not be backed up and exported to the ELN.",2
    Endif
remove ELN_Export

In the macro substitute:
Z:\ELN\ with the drive letter of the virtual network drive and folder path where the data is to be copied to.

Configuring the method to run the macro:

In ChemStation load the method that shoud transfer data. NOTE: This configuration needs to be done in every method that will be run on the 
chromatograph. From the "Method" menu of ChemStation's main window choose "Edit Entire Method...". In the pop-up window choose "Method information"
and accept. The "Method Information" window will open. Activate the "Post-Run Macros/Commands:" check box and select the previously created
macro as target in "Instrument Control:" (exampe: C:\msdchem\1\macros\ELN_Export.mac")


### Configurations in Chemotion ELN

The Chemotion ELNâ€™s data collector has to be configured to collect data of the GC/MS device from the network location.

As for the file collector mechanism, there are two options.

- Collecting attachment files from emails
- Collecting file or folder from local drives or over SCP

For this procedure the folder collection from local drives or over SCP needs to be chosen and configured to collect the data from the network drive
where the ChemStation macro has uploaded it to.
