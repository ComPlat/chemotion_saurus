title: Remote Device Control
---

Remote device control is an integral part of device integration. The device integration protocol generally enables the
remote access and transfer of data. Both these can be set up separately, with neither relying on the other. In this
guideline we have mainly discussed about the configurations for remote data or device access.

Users will be able to access the device through the Chemotion ELN. For that we have to make sure that the device PC
and the Chemotion ELN are connected to a common LAN. Furthermore the firewall of the LAN needs to allow VNC connections
to be established.

### Configurations in source PC

This has been achieved by the installation of the software, [TightVNC](https://www.tightvnc.com/download.php) (Installer
for Windows, 64-bit). Users can access the computer remotely through Chemotion ELN through this. We have to configure it
as follows,

On the setup screen, we have to select the TightVNC server to be installed along with the set up of the passwords for
remote access and administrative password.

After installation, we have to make sure it is accepting incoming connections at port 5900 and also for added security,
we have to whitelist the IP address of the Chemotion ELN only. Also we select the option so that the administrative
password is needed to make any changes or for each operation.

### Configurations in Chemotion ELN

There are basically two types of configurations we have to perform in Chemotion ELN,

- As an admin of Chemotion ELN
- As an admin of the group which the device belongs to

As an admin of Chemotion ELN, we have to create the device corresponding to the target device and configure the NoVNC
settings for it with a token.

On the other hand, as an admin of the group which the device belongs to, we have to make sure that the user belongs to the group in
Chemotion ELN in order to get access to the device. If the user is not already
in the group, then the group admin will have to add the user from Chemotion ELN.

For a user who is in the group, the user has to log in to the Chemotion ELN at
[https://complat-eln.ioc.kit.edu/home](https://complat-eln.ioc.kit.edu/home). Then he can access the device as follows,
