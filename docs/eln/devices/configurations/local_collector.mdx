title: Local collectors in docker containers
---

The ELN allows data to be collected automatically from an folder using the data-collector feature. This is useful for
sharing files between e.g. an instrument and the ELN. On the instrument side, the (analyses, result etc.) files can be
put in a (networked shared) folder. On the ELN side, we can monitor this folder for any changes and import files from
the instrument directly into the ELN.

## Configuration outside Chemotion ELN

Once the computer that is running the Chemotion ELN (docker container) has access to the shared folder, this folder can
then be mounted into the Chemotion ELN’s containers. To do so:

- Mount the shared folder in the containers using the `docker-compose.yml` file by adding the folder as a volume in the
keys `services.eln.volumes` and `services.worker.volumes`. In case you are using ChemCLI, make the changes in the
`docker-compose.cli.yml` file.

- Once added, the `docker-compose(.cli).yml` file could similar to the following:

```
services:
  eln:
    image: ...
     ...
    volumes:
      - ...
      - /path/to/folder/with/data:/chemotion/datacollector/instrument-name

  worker:
    image: ...
     ...
    volumes:
      - ...
      - /path/to/folder/with/data:/chemotion/datacollector/instrument-name

```

- We then will add this path to the config/datacollector.yml file which is located on the host in
`(instances/<instance-name>)/shared/pullin/config/datacollector.yml` as shown below. One has to create a new
config/datacollector.yml file if it does not exist.

  Note that, you can input multiple paths i.e. mount different
  instruments. For example, the second commented line here mounts the folder `/tmp/datacollector` which can point to some
  other instrument.

```
:localcollectors:
  - :path: '/chemotion/datacollector'
# - :path: '<%= Rails.root.join(*%w[tmp datacollector]).to_s %>'
```

- The ELN needs to be restarted once these changes have been made.
For more information, for example, configuring the frequency for collecting the files, please check
[Data collector settings](https://www.chemotion.net/docs/eln/install_configure/configuration#data-collector-settings)

## Configurations in Chemotion ELN: Admin Panel

We have to navigate to _Groups & Devices_ in the admin panel and create a new device instance. It will register the device
information to the database of the Chemotion ELN.

### File Collector

Along with that a data collector profile will be automatically generated. For the local collectors, we only need to
specify the following,
  - Watch Method (_filewatcherlocal/folderwatcherlocal_)
  - Watch Directory - Specify the directory created inside the locally mounted folder. Here CV-data, for example, has
  been created within the mounted folder, datacollector

In this case we will configure the watch method as `filewatcherlocal` as we intend to collect files from the
specified Watch Directory.

![collector_configuration_1](/img/collector_configuration2.png)

As the next step, files from the `./datacollector/CV-data` will now keep being collected by the collector in the
Chemotion ELN. We have to make sure that the name of the files start with the name abbreviation (Kürzel) of a specific
user. The file will reach the inbox of that particular user. In case the name abbreviation is not valid, then the file
will be discarded.

:::info

Please take care that you communicate [name conventions](https://www.chemotion.net/docs/eln/devices#name-conventions)
to all users of the Chemotion ELN.

:::

:::danger

The directories watched by the collector service will be emptied at each collection i. e. all files within the watched
directories will be removed.

:::

### Folder Collector

All the configurations are more or less the same as in the File Collector. Here we will need to configure the Watch
Method as `folderwatcherlocal`.

![collector_configuration_1](/img/collector_configuration3.png)

Here is a new input to consider, i.e. `Number of files`. As mentioned in the info text in the Chemotion ELN, if the
folders to be collected may contain a variable number of files, then we have to set it to 0. Otherwise if the number of
files within the collectable folder is known, we can set it as that.

Here also we have to make sure that the name of the folder to be collected has to start with the name abbreviation
(Kürzel) of a specific user.
