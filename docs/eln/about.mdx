# Chemotion ELN
The Chemotion ELN was initiated in the working group of Stefan Bräse at the Institute of Organic Chemistry (IOC)/Institute of Biological and Chemical Systems (IBCS) of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). Currently, the software is developed by developers working at the north campus of the KIT and developers at the universities Jena, Braunschweig, Halle and RWTH Aachen.
The Chemotion ELN is a development for chemists and other scientists working in related fields.

We would like to thank many other institutions and developers who contributed code, ideas and finished subcomponents. The Chemotion ELN could only come into being with the support of developers from NinjaConcept and Cubuslab. Further sub-components are available through the cooperation with NMRdb and SciFinder.
The project has been funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and by the state of Baden-Württemberg.

# Support, Workshops, Introductions
There are differnt options to become familiar with Chemotion ELN and to request support. The training activities for Chemotion are strongly supported by the team of NFDI4Chem.

- Please visit us in our biweekly Q&A session (every second Thursday): https://www.nfdi4chem.de/index.php/event/chemotion-eln-qa-session/, or

- request an introduction to the ELN via the NFDI4Chem helpdesk: https://www.nfdi4chem.de/index.php/helpdesk/

- request a workshop for groups via the NFDI4Chem helpdesk: https://www.nfdi4chem.de/index.php/helpdesk/

# Contact the team and/or give feedback

If Chemotion is used in your laboratory, we would be very happy to receive a short message.
This allows us to document the number of users in order to track the interest in our journal.
The team is looking forward to any kind of feedback, suggestions and criticism.

- If you would like to report individual issues, please open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/issues.
Please give as many details as possible (preferably also images or screenshots) to facilitate the understanding of the issue.

- If you have a list of issues/points of interest, please send a list of issues to nicole.jung[at]kit.edu.

- For NFDI4chem members: please add individual issues to GitHub or submit lists of issues to the contact person of your sub-discipline (see following contact persons):
