### Main Toolbar

The main toolbar allows users to change the calendar view, and move back and forth.

The user can select between 5 different views:

1. Month
2. Week
3. Working week
4. Day
5. Agenda - shows upcoming events for a month after the currently selected date.

The main calendar shows all user created events / shared collection events.
