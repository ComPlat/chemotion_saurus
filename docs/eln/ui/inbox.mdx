In the Chemotion ELN, we have an inbox section. There are several ways we can have data in the User's inbox. It is
closely linked with the integrated devices as well.

## Transfer data to the inbox using email

One of the easiest ways to transfer data to Chemotion ELN is to send it via email. Users can easily send themselves
files by emailing them from their registered email addresses to some predefined email address. The email address to use
for sending the files is now visible in the inbox popup window.

Senders of files to this email address will receive them straight into their inbox.

## Transfer data to the inbox using data collector

Data collector configurations have been done in many of the integrated devices. For these, files/folders are being
collected automatically and when the name of the file/folder starts with a unique identifier registered with the
Chemotion ELN user accounts, those reach the user's inbox at regular intervals of time.

## Manual upload

Along with all these, users can manually upload some files in the inbox which they can later use in further analyses.

## Moving files to elements (into the analyses section)

### Manual import of files from the inbox into the analyses section

When working with datasets, you can drag and drop files directly from the inbox into `Analyses`.

![Drag and Drop](/img/analyses_drag_inbox_files.gif)

Alternatively, you can use the buttons next to the file in the inbox to open a dialog that suggests elements to that the data should be assigned to.
In this dialog, you can select the appropriate element and assign the file to it. A new `Analysis` is created, including this file as a dataset.

The list of available elements in the list of the inbox depends on the file name as the system automatically searches for elements with matching or partially matching names.

:::note

- Currently, only samples and reactions are supported.
- The function to gain suggestions to assign data has to be enabled in the user configuration.

:::info

The file name (excluding the file extension) should contain:
- The full name of the element or a part of it
- The short label of the element or a part of it (e.g. CU1-1)

:::

### Automatic transfer of files from the inbox

If the file name of an item in the inbox can be uniquely assigned to an existing element (currently only samples and reactions),
the file will be automatically assigned to it.
The automatic assignment of the data to the sample or reaction creates a new `Analysis` with the file added as a dataset.

:::note

This feature can be disabled in the user configuration.

:::

### Reaction variations link

When you assign a file to a reaction and this reaction has one or multiple variations,
the resulting `Analysis` can automatically be linked to a variation.
To enable this, the filename needs to consist of:
1. full name or short label (part)
2. A minus (-) sign followed by **v** + variation index
3. optional file extension

Example name: CU1-R1-**v**1.dat
