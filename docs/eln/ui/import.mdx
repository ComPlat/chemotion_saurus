# Import Samples from Excel

Samples can be imported to chemotion ELN by uploading a simple excel list that contains the structure of the sample as Smiles string.
Please add the smiles strings in column A of the file to be imported and please add the description "canonical smiles" as header of column A.
To enable the import into a collection, the desired target collection has to be selected. Import of samples is only possible for the user that created the collection.
The export and import of samples is currently supported in the xlsx, csv, and sdf formats.

For a more comprehensive import of data into chemotion ELN based on Smiles strings, please see the following example which can be used as a template to import data to the Chemotion ELN.

  <DownloadBtn
    files={["/files/template_sample_import.xlsx"]}

  />
