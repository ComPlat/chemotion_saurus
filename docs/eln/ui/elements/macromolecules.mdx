The module for sequence-based macromolecules allows the definition and storage of large molecules based on repeating building blocks. Currently, proteins are supported, with other macromolecules such as RNA and DNA planned for the future.

:::caution[Current Limitations:]
(1) SBMMs cannot yet be used as components of chemical reactions; this feature is scheduled for a future release. 
(2) Some calculations in the SMBMM model are not yet supported.
:::

## Concept
SBMMs are implemented as elements in the ELN. That means that they can be retrieved from the elements' list and have a detailed view upon clicking on the single entries in the elements list. SBMMs consist of a concept that describes the properties, identifiers and characteristics of the SBMM molecule and the SBMM sample. he SBMM sample is characterized by additional properties that are batch specific. 

## Creation of an SBMM
In a first step, the type of sequence-based macromolecule is chosen. At the moment, only the type "protein" is supported. The user can either 
(1) re-use exising proteins that are already stored of the ELN database and can be retrieved from the elements' list (use drag and drop field) 
(2) search a protein in the ELN database or in uniprot and create a new sample assigned to it (dropdown options)
(3) create a protein from scratch (dropdown options)

Depending on how the protein is gained or where data describing the protein can be gained from, the user has the option to define SBMMs for that the characteristics correspond to UniProt entries, that are derived from Uniprot and modified, and those that are not known.

If a UniProt reference is available, the Uniprot entry can be used to extract all relevant information on the protein's structure and characteristics. The information is added to the Chemotion SBMM.
