---

The module for sequence-based macromolecules allows the definition and storage of large molecules based on repeating building blocks. Currently, proteins are supported, with other macromolecules such as RNA and DNA planned for the future.

:::caution[Current Limitations:]
(1) SBMMs cannot yet be used as components of chemical reactions; this feature is scheduled for a future release. 
(2) Some calculations in the SMBMM model are not yet supported.
