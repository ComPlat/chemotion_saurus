Wellplates <Wellplate title="Wellplate" className="logo" width={"30px"}/> represent the localization of materials (chemicals) for biological experiments and are therefore some kind of link between chemical and biological operations.

## Creation

![Create Wellplate](/img/create_wellplate.gif)
Wellplates can be created through different options via the dropdown menu in the <img src={require('@site/static/img/action_bar_create_wellplate.png').default} alt={"create wellplate"} height={"7%"} width={"7%"}/> in the **Action Bar**. Find the Action Bar in the structure of the [Action Bar](../../ui#action-bar).

The first element in the blue button looks differently according to the tab that is selected in the **Element Bar**, for example if you are on the Sample Tab there will be a <Sample title="Sample" className="logo" width={"30px"}/> instead of <Wellplate title="Wellplate" className="logo" width={"30px"}/>.

1. A blank wellplate can be created by clicking on the <button className={"button button--sm button--primary"} style={{padding:"2px", height: "50%", width: "5%"}}><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlus} size="lg"/></button> when the wellplate tab is selected or with the option **Create Wellplate** from the dropdown menu <button className={"button button--sm button--primary"} style={{padding:"2px", height: "50%", width: "5%"}}><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faSortDown} size="lg"/></button>. The blank wells of the plate can be filled in the **Designer** tab via drag and drop with samples from the samples list.

2. A filled wellplate can be created from one or multiple sample(s) when the samples are selected in the sample list on the sample tab. Then select **Create Wellplate from Samples** in the dropdown menu. After that the wellplate in the **Designer** tab is automatically filled with the selected samples. This action is a combination of the action **split** of the selected samples together with the insertion of the created split samples in the wellplate. The wellplate will be gradually filled with the created split samples. If the number of the split samples exceeds the free positions in the wellplate, there will be a second wellplate created and filled automatically.

A wellplate can be saved, edited and deleted in the [details panel view](../details#details-panel-for-wellplates).

### Adjust the size of a wellplate

![wellplate](/img/wellplate.gif)

During the creation the size of a wellplate can be adjusted in the **Properties** tab by clicking on the <button className={"button button--sm button--primary"} style={{padding:"2px", height: "50%", width: "5%"}}><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBraille} size="lg"/></button>. The size of the wellplate can be adjusted by changing the values **Width** and **Height** and pressing the **Apply** button. Be aware, that once a wellplate is created, the size can not be changed anymore.
