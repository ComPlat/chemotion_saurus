## Overview

Currently, samples are treated as single molecules without categorization. However, we plan to classify samples into
different types, including:
- Mixtures
- Polymers
- Metal organic framework
- Other specialized categories

The Mixture module extends the samples feature by providing advanced tools for managing chemical mixtures.
It allows users to define, modify, and calculate various mixture properties, including:
- Components and their properties
- Concentration calculations
- Volume and amount adjustments

Each mixture consists of multiple components, making it a powerful tool for handling complex sample formulations.

## Key Features

- **Component Management**
  - Allows adding, removing, and modifying components in a mixture.
- **Advanced Calculations**
  - Computes total concentration based on individual component concentrations.
  - Recalculate volume and amount dynamically.
- **Stock and Reference Tracking**
  - Supports stock concentration tracking and recalculations based on a reference component.
- **Intuitive Drag-and-Drop UI**
  - Rearrange components effortlessly using drag-and-drop functionality.

## Integration with UI Components

The Mixtures module integrates seamlessly with the Sample element, offering an intuitive UI for managing mixtures.

### Sample Type Selection

### Sample Element Updates

Here is an overview of the default Sample interface:

Once the Mixtures option is selected, the primary focus shifts to the **Components Table**:

### Key UI Elements
- **Component List:** Displays all components within the mixture.
- **Input Fields:** Allows users to modify various attributes like concentration, volume, amount, stock data etc.
- **Drag-and-Drop Support:** Enables reordering of components.
- **Component Category:** Separate sections for **Liquids** and **Solids** to ensure organized mixture management.

## Creating Mixtures
Users can add components to a mixture using:

1. **Drag-and-Drop:** Select components from the sample list and add them directly.
2. **Drawing in Ketcher:** Draw the mixture using Ketcher 1 or 2.
3. **Hybrid Approach:** Combine both methods (e.g., draw two components and drag in a third to create a three-component
mixture).

## Calculations and Dependencies

This section outlines the key calculations and dependencies between various attributes in the Component list. Each
attribute plays a specific role in determining the values of other related attributes. Some values remain fixed
unless explicitly modified by the user, while others dynamically adjust based on dependencies.

### Stock/Density
- These attributes serve as the foundation for all calculations.
- Users can enter either the stock or density value for each component.
- By default, these values are locked to prevent unintended modifications.
- If a user drags and drops an existing sample as a component, these values are automatically populated.
- To modify them, the user must unlock the field.
- These values do not change dynamically when other attributes are updated; instead, modifying them resets other
attribute values.
- The lock indicates that these values rely solely on user input and are never recalculated based on changes in other
attributes.

### Volume/Amount
- These two attributes are interdependent.
- A change in one automatically adjusts the other to maintain consistency.
- Updates to these values can also impact other attributes such as Ratio and Total Concentration, which are
recalculated based on predefined conditions.

### Ratio/Reference (Ref)
- These values define how components relate to each other in terms of their proportion in a mixture.
- When a component is selected as the Reference, its Ratio is automatically set to 1.
- The Volume, Amount, and other values of non-reference components are adjusted according to their assigned Ratios.

### Total Concentration (Total Conc.)
- Represents the final concentration of the mixture.
- Users can choose to lock or unlock this field for specific components.
- If unlocked, it will be dynamically adjusted based on other attribute changes.
- If locked, other attributes, along with the Total volume, will be recalculated while keeping this value fixed.
- This value will be calculated only when there is a Total volume.

### Total volume
- Indicates the overall volume of the mixture.
- The sum of the volumes of all components must not exceed this total value.
- It is only a value given manually, i.e. volume by definition - not (re)calculated. Recalculation occurs only when
the attributes of a component with a locked total concentration are modified.
- If the combined volume of all components is less than the specified total volume, you are expected to add solvent(s)
to compensate for the remaining volume.

### Required volume
- Represents the calculation of the volume required to get the desired concentration of a selected component in the
mixture.
- This is a calculated value based on the Reference component. Please use the reference (Ref) button to select the
component.
- It is used for informational purposes only and does not directly affect other attributes. The calculation is a helper
for planning the reaction's components, it does not have impact on the component table.
- This value is determined using input from the row where the reference component is defined.

## Changes in the Solvents Table
- **Volume Column** added for mixtures.
- **Ratio Adjustments** occur automatically when volume is updated.
- **Non-Visualized Solvents:** Some buffer solutions/solvents can be excluded from the combined SVG representation.

### ðŸ’¡ Total Volume and Solvent Addition

The **total volume** of a sample refers to the final desired volume, including all components and any solvent(s).

When the **sum of the volumes of all components** in a mixture is **less than** the specified total volume, the
remaining volume is typically filled by adding one or more **solvents**. This ensures the mixture reaches the intended
inal volume.

#### ðŸ“˜ Example

```plaintext
Total volume specified: 10 mL
Component A volume:     3 mL
Component B volume:     4 mL
-----------------------------
Total component volume: 7 mL
Remaining volume:       3 mL

In this case, 3 mL of solvent should be added to reach the total volume of 10 mL.
```

## Future Enhancements

âœ… Use mixtures in reaction schemes
âœ… Enable import/export of mixture samples, including components
âœ… Improve searchability by mixture components
