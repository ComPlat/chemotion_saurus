## Overview

Currently, samples are treated as single molecules without categorization. However, we plan to classify samples into
different types, including:
- Mixtures
- Polymers
- Metal organic framework
- Other specialized categories

The Mixture module extends the samples feature by providing advanced tools for managing chemical mixtures.
It allows users to define, modify, and calculate various mixture properties, including:
- Components and their properties
- Concentration calculations
- Volume and amount adjustments

Each mixture consists of multiple components, making it a powerful tool for handling complex sample formulations.

## Key Features

- **Component Management**
  - Allows adding, removing, and modifying components in a mixture.
- **Advanced Calculations**
  - Computes total concentration based on individual component concentrations.
  - Recalculate volume and amount dynamically.
- **Stock and Reference Tracking**
  - Supports stock concentration tracking and recalculations based on a reference component.
- **Intuitive Drag-and-Drop UI**
  - Rearrange components effortlessly using drag-and-drop functionality.

## Integration with UI Components

The Mixtures module integrates seamlessly with the Sample element, offering an intuitive UI for managing mixtures.

### Sample Type Selection

### Sample Element Updates

Here is an overview of the default Sample interface:

Once the Mixtures option is selected, the primary focus shifts to the **Components Table**:

### Key UI Elements
- **Component List:** Displays all components within the mixture.
- **Input Fields:** Allows users to modify various attributes like concentration, volume, amount, stock data etc.
- **Drag-and-Drop Support:** Enables reordering of components.
- **Component Category:** Separate sections for **Liquids** and **Solids** to ensure organized mixture management.

## Creating Mixtures
Users can add components to a mixture using:

1. **Drag-and-Drop:** Select components from the sample list and add them directly.
2. **Drawing in Ketcher:** Draw the mixture using Ketcher 1 or 2.
3. **Hybrid Approach:** Combine both methods (e.g., draw two components and drag in a third to create a three-component
mixture).

### Example: Creating a Mixture

## Changes in the Solvents Table
- **Volume Column** added for mixtures.
- **Ratio Adjustments** occur automatically when volume is updated.
- **Non-Visualized Solvents:** Some buffer solutions/solvents can be excluded from the combined SVG representation.

## Future Enhancements

✅ Use mixtures in reaction schemes
✅ Enable import/export of mixture samples, including components
✅ Improve searchability by mixture components
