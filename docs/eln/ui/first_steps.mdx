## Registration

Registration is a necessary step towards using the electronic laboratory notebook (ELN). Please register on your first visit to the ELN. Then use this access data for each subsequent login. The registration page or the login page will always be the first page accessed.

## SciFinder/SciFinder<sup>n</sup> Credential

This step is only required if you have been granted permission to use the [Search CAS](../ui/details#search-cas) (<Btn mixed={[faSearch, "Search CAS"]} color={"secondary"} />) feature (ELN 1.3+ versions) or the SciFinder tab feature (prior to ELN 1.0.0).
Both of these features query information in SciFinder/SciFinder<sup>n</sup> by using an API.

:::info NOTE
Please note that you must register once with CAS to obtain your personal CAS username and password.
:::

You can register the SciFindern credential in the "Account & Profile".

## The First Collection

![Collection View](/img/first_collection.gif)

A **collection** is a collection of elements (**Sample**, **Reaction**, **Wellplate**, **Screen**, **Research Plan** and others) that is assigned to a project or subproject. Two collections are given per default: **chemotion-repository.net** and **All**. The **chemotion-repository.net** collection is a connector to the chemotion repository and should not be used in the first Chemotion ELN trials. The collection **All** is installed as backup, it contains all entries of the Chemotion ELN independent of other assignments. The creation of the first own collection is usually the first step in the Chemotion ELN and allows to store your own elements.
For the creation of collections please use the collection management via the red button <Btn mixed={[faCog]} color={"danger"}/> in the collection bar. Please create a new entry **New Collection** under **My Collections** by pressing <Btn mixed={[faPlus]} color={"success"}/>. Please rename the collection and save it by pressing <Btn mixed={["Save"]} color={"warning"}/>.

:::danger Caution
To use the Chemotion ELN functions, a first user-defined collection has to be created!
Please think about a smart structure for your Chemotion ELN and create your first collection!
