## Overview

As of version 1.5.0, images can be edited or annotated directly in the Chemotion ELN UI without an external editor.

:::info Supported file formats
Editable file types are .png, .bmp, .tiff, .tif, .svg, .jpg and .jpeg.

tif and tiff format is converted to png format before annotation to be able to display it in the browser. The original image is preserved and remains unchanged.

Images in research plans that were created before version 1.5.0 cannot be edited at the moment.

## Procedure

- Before editing an image, it must first be saved in order to make the necessary preparations on the server.
- When the editor is started for the first time, the user is asked whether he wants to save the settings and the history locally.
- Previously placed elements can be edited subsequently. In addition, texts can be changed later on.
- After editing the image, the corresponding element must be saved in order to permanently apply the changes and make them visible.

### Availability

Images can be edited in several places on the ELN:

- **In Research Plan (body)**
