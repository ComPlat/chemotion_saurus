Editable file types are png, bmp, tiff, tif, svg, jpg and jpeg

:::info
tif and tiff format is converted to png format before annotation to be able to display it in the browser. The original image will be preserved and remains unchanged
:::
:::info
When the editor is started for the first time, the user is asked whether he wants to save the settings and the history locally.
:::
:::caution
Before editing an image, it must first be saved in order to make the necessary preparations on the server.

## Editor ##

The integrated editor is [svgedit](https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit). The editor can be divided into 4 different areas.
<img src={require("@site/static/img/image_annotation/20230306_image_annotation_editor.png").default} alt={"Sharing"} />

### 1 - Toolbar ###
Provides various tools for manipulating the image. There are graphic tools (circles, rectangles, ...), a free-form tool and the possibility to add text

### 2 - Canvas ###
The canvas for adding graphic elements or text
:::info
Elements outside the original image size are currently trimmed
:::

### 3 - Magnification tools ###
Offers the user the possibility to enlarge or reduce the current canvas. Automatic adjustment to the screen shape is also possible (fit to canvas).

### 4 - Colour selection ###

## Further hints ##
- Previously placed elements can be edited subsequently. In addition, texts can be changed later on
- After editing the image, the corresponding element must be saved in order to permanently apply the changes and make them visible
- Images in research plans that were created before version 1.5.0 cannot be edited at the moment
