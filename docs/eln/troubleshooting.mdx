## Chemotion ELN is not responding

In individual cases, it may happen that the Chemotion ELN does not react to an action. If you have the feeling that your application is not giving any feedback, please reload the page by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd>. If the problem persists, please contact us using the [helpdesk](/helpdesk).

## Actions are not activated

Check whether you are in your work collection. The **All Collection** tab is not intended for changes.

## Functions are not allowed

If you want to carry out an action and the corresponding button for carrying it out is not activated, it may be because you first have to save your previous entries. This error occurs, for example, if you want to edit a sample in a reaction, but the sample has recently been inserted into the reaction table (by **split** or **copy**). If the new sample has not yet been saved in the reaction table, you cannot use various functions.

## Fixing Sample or Molecule SVG images

**(in ELN v1.5.4 and above)**

A script to reprocess the SVGs of molecules and samples is available (see [PR1308](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/pull/1308/commits/868477dc91cec99b689db2ac93106d04ce8dd694)). For this to run properly, the Ketcher backend service has to be working. Note that depending on the situation, this could consume a lot of resources.
To run the script from your application directory with rails environment, use `bundle exec rake 'svg:{molecule|sample}[{all|missing|openbabel}]'`;
examples:

- reprocess missing molecule SVGs: `bundle exec rake svg:molecule`

- reprocess all molecule SVGs with molecule id &gt;= 200: `bundle exec rake 'svg:molecule[all, 200]'`

- reprocess missing sample SVGs with sample 100 &lt;= id &lt;= 200: `bundle exec rake 'svg:sample[missing, 100, 200]'`

- reprocess openbabel generated molecule SVGs: `bundle exec rake 'svg:molecule[openbabel]'`

If docker compose is used, the command can be run from the host where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located. For example, to run the command using the `worker` service:

```
docker compose exec worker bundle exec rake 'svg:molecule[openbabel]'
```
