# Overview of the Converter functions

The purpose of the Chemotion Converter (in short: ChemConverter) is to convert different file formats and types from [integrated devices](/docs/eln/devices) to a common and well known data type, namely e.g. jcamp .jdx or .json.
It is also possible to extract columns for 2D data visualization and Metadata.
Currently, the ChemConverter can handle most text readable files like txt/csv/dta if they are properly structured, but developers can create their own readers if a rule is notable for the newly added file type.

Most of the time, the ChemConverter runs as a background process when the user or a measurement device uploads a analytic file to the ELN.
The prerequisite is that an admin has created a suitable [profile](/docs/eln/converter/converter_profile).
There is also a standalone version of the converter which you can find and install from [Github](https://github.com/jochenklar/chemotion-converter-app).
