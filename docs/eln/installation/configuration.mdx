## User name_abbreviation
Name abbreviation, like e-mails, are unique in the DB and can be used for sign in.
The length of it can be defined in the `user_props.yml` configuration file:

```sh
# from the application dir (/var/www/chemotion_ELN/current) copy the config file
cp config/user_props.yml.example config/user_props.yml

# edit it
vim config/user_props.yml

# restart the application (assuming Passenger is being used)
touch tmp/restart.txt

# keep the configuration for future Chemotion ELN updates (assuming Capistrano is used)
mv config/user_props.yml /var/www/chemotion_ELN/shared/config/user_props.yml
ln -s  /var/www/chemotion_ELN/shared/config/user_props.yml /var/www/chemotion_ELN/current/config/user_props.yml
```

## SciFinder<sup>n</sup>

Chemotion ELN provides users with an easy way to query information in SciFinder<sup>n</sup> by using an API. To enable the use of the API, your institute needs to have a regular SciFinder<sup>n</sup> license. For each ELN instance, a registration at CAS is needed.
This is managed by the Chemotion team at KIT to facilitate the process.

### Instance Registeration

For requesting a license for SciFinder<sup>n</sup> API use in Chemotion, please send a short request including the following information to [nicole.jung@kit.edu](mailto:nicole.jung@kit.edu).

* Institution
* Redirect URL pattern list
  * _The URL patterns represent the domain names that you will use to host your ELN server. The patterns may use standard wildcard characters (for example, '*' for 0 or more characters).  Be sure to include all environments (including dev, test, etc.) that you might provision._
* Contact information

Once the process is complete, you will receive a Client ID which you can enable the feature by following the "Settings" section below.

### Settings

To enable this feature, the necessary information needs to be configured in the `scfinder_n.yml` file.
  
The `scfinder_n.yml` configuration file is in the `config` folder. To create the file for the first time,

```sh
# from the application dir (/var/www/chemotion_ELN/current) copy the config file
cp config/scfinder_n.yml.example config/scfinder_n.yml

# edit it
vim config/scfinder_n.yml

# restart the application (assuming Passenger is being used)
touch tmp/restart.txt

# keep the configuration for future Chemotion ELN updates (assuming Capistrano is used)
mv config/scfinder_n.yml /var/www/chemotion_ELN/shared/config/scfinder_n.yml
ln -s  /var/www/chemotion_ELN/shared/config/scfinder_n.yml /var/www/chemotion_ELN/current/config/scfinder_n.yml
```

scfinder_n.yml:

```sh

## Set the hostname for generating proper file download links

In order for file downloads links (e. g., in exporting [collections](/docs/eln/collections)) to work correctly, you have to configure the hostname of your Chemotion ELN. Set the following variable accordingly in the `.env` file:

```
PUBLIC_URL='https://my.hostname.edu'
```

:::info NOTE
`PUBLIC_URL` has been replacing the `HOST` and `SMTP_HOST` variables since version v1.4.
:::

## e-mail-service (optional)

This is used for sending the users an e-mail confirmation request, reset password instructions, or other notifications.

e-mail configuration parameters are set as environment variables in the `.env` file.
below is the list of available parameters:

```sh
# default url of your Chemotion ELN for http links in e-mails:
PUBLIC_URL='https://sld.tld'
# senders e-mail:
DEVISE_SENDER='no-reply@sld.tld'

## SMTP config
# Remote mail server
SMTP_ADDRESS='smtp.sld.tld'
SMTP_PORT=587
# login user name & password if applicable:
SMTP_USERNAME='no-reply@sld.tld'
SMTP_PASSWORD='s3cr3tPW'
# optional, HELO domain
SMTP_DOMAIN='sld.tld'
# detect STARTTLS
SMTP_TLS=true
# authentication type ('plain' 'login' (Base64 encoded) or 'cram_md5')
SMTP_AUTH='plain'
# how OpenSSL checks the certificate  ('none' or 'peer')
SMTP_SSL_MODE='none'
```

See [rails docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#action-mailer-configuration) for an explanation of the parameters.


## File collector

This is an optional service to collect data files and distribute them to the Chemotion ELN inbox of the respective users.

(see the [devices overview](devices) or [doi: 10.1016/j.acax.2019.100007 ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acax.2019.100007 ))

Two options are available:
- collecting attachment files from e-mails
- collecting file or folder from local drives or over scp

### e-mail-attachment collection

The Chemotion ELN-app should be given access to an e-mail account in which it will regularly check for incoming e-mails and collect the attachments.
The attachments are then distributed to Chemotion ELN user by matching the additional addressee present in the __To:__ or __CC:__ field of the e-mail. The sender's e-mail address should also be one of an Chemotion ELN-registered device. 

:::danger 
All new incoming e-mails are processed and discarded. 
If the sender and other addresssees are unknown to the Chemotion ELN (e-mails registered to Chemotion ELN accounts), then the e-mail will be directly deleted.
:::


### File collection

Files can be collected from remote storages and distributed to specific user based on the file-name matching the user's name abbreviation.

:::danger 
The directories watched by the collector service will be emptied at each collection i. e. all files within the watched directories will be removed.
:::


### Data-collector settings

Configure the frequency for collecting the files, as well as the e-mail access in the `config/datacollectors.yml` file.
The background worker will collect the files at the frequencies set.
If login credentials are needed, those are set in the configuration file as well.

```sh
### example of configdatacollector.yml 
production:
  :services:
    - :name: 'mailcollector'
      :cron: '5,20,35,50 * * * *' # every 15 minutes starting a xx:05
    - :name: 'folderwatchersftp'
      :every: 5 # minutes
      :watcher_sleep: 30 # seconds
    - :name: 'folderwatcherlocal'
      :every: 5 # minutes
      :watcher_sleep: 30 # seconds
    - :name: 'filewatchersftp'
      :every: 2 # minutes
    - :name: 'filewatcherlocal'
      :every: 2 # minutes

  ## Chemotion ELN e-mail account
  :mailcollector:
    :server: 'imap.server.de'
    :mail_address: "service@mail"
    :password: "password"
    # :port: 993 default
    # :ssl: true default
    :aliases:
      - 'alias_one@kit.edu'
      - 'alias_two@kit.edu'
  
  ## File collection over ssh with password 
  :sftpusers:
    - :user: 'user1'
      :password: 'pass'
    - :user: 'user2'
      :password: 'pass'

  # Dir of ssh keys for data collection over sftp
  :keydir: 'config/data_collector_keys'

  # Allowlist of dir paths for local data collection
  :localcollectors:
    - :path: '<%= Rails.root.join(*%w[tmp datacollector]).to_s %>'
```

:::info NB
After editing the datacollectors.yml the worker service (DelayedJob) needs to be restarted.
:::

For each registered Device, a collection job can be set up through the administrator interface:

## External services 

### Chem-Spectra-App

If you are using the docker production setup, the service is already installed and configured, but you can still decide to overwrite the configuration file to use another instance of the service.

#### Installation

Use this installation guide: https://github.com/ComPlat/chem-spectra-app/blob/master/INSTALL.md

#### Configuration in Chemotion-ELN

To configure Chemotion-ELN to connect to Chem-Spectra, create a configuration file:

```sh
# from the application dir (/var/www/chemotion_ELN/current) copy the config file 
cd /var/www/chemotion_ELN/current
cp config/spectra.yml.example config/spectra.yml
```

If you followed the above installation guide you may edit `spectra.yml` as follows:

```sh
production:
  :url: '127.0.0.1'
  :port: '3007'
```

Restart the application (assuming Passenger is being used):

```sh
touch tmp/restart.txt
```

To keep the configuration for future Chemotion ELN updates (assuming Capistrano is used):
```sh
mv config/spectra.yml /var/www/chemotion_ELN/shared/config/spectra.yml
ln -s  /var/www/chemotion_ELN/shared/config/spectra.yml /var/www/chemotion_ELN/current/config/spectra.yml
```

#### Automatic startup in crontab

To make sure Chem-Spectra is started on reboot you can use this BASH script in your root crontab (if required, adapt Chemotion-ELN username and home directory):

```sh
#!/bin/bash

sudo -H -u production bash -c "cd /home/production/chem-spectra-app && \
  source /home/production/anaconda3/bin/activate chem-spectra && \
  gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:3007 server:app --daemon"

docker run --detach --name msconvert_docker \
    --rm -it \
    -e WINEDEBUG=-all \
    -v /home/production/chem-spectra-app/chem_spectra/tmp:/data \   ## Modify path according to your installation
    chambm/pwiz-skyline-i-agree-to-the-vendor-licenses bash
```


### VNC
Access remote Desktops with VNC using websockify


![adminui-vnc](/img/ELN-VNC.png)

installation: https://github.com/novnc/websockify

A VNC server needs to be installed on each remote machine.

setting: through the [Administrator-interface](/docs/eln/admin_ui/novnc_settings)



### Onlyoffice

Install [OnlyOffice](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu.aspx?_ga=2.2091185.1060566386.1612303438-123622021.1612303437) instance on a server:

```sh
# from the application dir (/var/www/chemotion_ELN/current) copy the config file 
cp config/editors.yml.example config/editors.yml

# edit it
vim config/editors.yml

# restart the application (assuming Passenger is being used)
touch tmp/restart.txt

# keep the configuration for future Chemotion ELN updates (assuming Capistrano is used)
mv config/editors.yml /var/www/chemotion_ELN/shared/config/editors.yml
ln -s  /var/www/chemotion_ELN/shared/config/editors.yml /var/www/chemotion_ELN/current/config/editors.yml
```

### Computed properties 

source:
installation:  

hint: Turbomols license needed
settings the computed-properties can be done directly from the Admin-UI, and are saved in the DB

Application will need to be restarted

## Dynamic Welcome e-mail and Message (optional)

:::caution
This feature is still in Beta version.
:::

This configuration enables sending a welcome message as an e-mail to the new users upon registration. It also displays the same content as a welcome message at the home page. The content is dynamic and can be modified and updated anytime.

![adminui-welcomemessage](/img/adminui-welcomemessage.PNG)

The message is rendered via .md file, you can find the sample file [here.](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/blob/development-5/public/welcome-message-sample.md)
In order to configure this, you just need to create a similar file as above in the same `public` directory named as `welcome-message.md`. You can copy the content from the sample file and modify the message as you wish.

:::note
Restarting of server might be required if you are adding the file to an already running instance.
