For the use of the Chemotion systems ELN and Repository, Chrome is recommended. Firefox can be used for most of the actions, but special functions in e.g. ChemSpectra behave differently.

:::caution Recommendation
Please use Chrome as browser in the current version.
:::

Other browsers such as Firefox or Internet Explorer only allow limited functionality in some areas of the application (e.g. collection managment and ChemSpectra).

There are two ways to use the ELN:
1. A test server is available for test purposes and time-limited applications. The test server is freely accessible to all interested users and makes it possible to test the latest version of ELN for its suitability for your own application without prior installation. We ask you not to keep any logging via this test system. Due to system updates and database changes, no guarantee can be given for the data set. Some functions cannot be made available via this test application. The SciFinder plug-in is not approved for free access via the test server.

:::info
There is no SciFinder available in the test version.
:::
2. For routine use in operations, it is recommended that a supervising admin install it on an institute, group or university server. The installation is described in detail at the end of this manual, but should still be carried out by someone with experience in server administration.

:::danger Caution
Never use the test system in operation. Risk of data loss!
