The UI offers different options to adjust the active windows, allowing a more convenient organisation of the ELN content.  

### Zoom the whole screen
For a change of the overall content size, please use the zoom function of the browser. The zoom affects all lists and information in the ELN.

### Hide and view collections and lists
If the use of collections is not necessary for the work with the ELN, the user can hide the collections bar. The resulting view includes the list of elements and the detail modal of the UI. If also the list of elements is not used and only the detail modal to be edited, you may select the enlarge button within the detail modal. The detail modal is given as window in full screen mode.

### Adjust the element lists
The element lists contain several elements per default, others can be enabled using the light blue button at the top of each list. Additonal elements can be loaded by dragging element symbols from the grey area to the white area in the given selection modal. Also, undesired list elements can be dragged from the white to the grey area. The action is closed by clicking to any other item in the ELN UI.
