This guide will help you getting started developing with containers by setting up Docker Desktop for Windows with WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). By enabling the WSL-2 based engine, you can run both Linux and Windows containers in Docker Desktop on the same machine

 


This documentation details an installation solution of the chemotion_ELN system. We will used Windows Subsystem for Linux.The instructions have been tested on Windows 10. Depending on your base operating system, the following packages must be installed:

 


### Dependencies

 

Ensure your machine is running Windows 10, updated to version 2004, Build 18362 or higher.
- install WSL-2 (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
- Install ubuntu (20.04.2) via the microsoft store
- Install Desktop Docker (https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/)

 

 

## Tools recommended for development

 

Visual Studio Code 
- Install Visual studio code with linters set up (es and ruby-rubocop):
  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby && https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint

 


- Install version control extension
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol

 

- Install the VS Code Docker extension. This extension adds the functionality to build, manage, and deploy containerized applications from inside VS Code. (You need the Remote-Container extension to actually use the container as your dev environment.)

# Setup

 

With the WSL 2 backend supported in Docker Desktop for Windows, you can work in a Linux-based development environment and build Linux-based containers, while using Visual Studio Code for code editing and debugging, and running your container in the Microsoft Edge browser on Windows.

 


Set docker desktop setting (Docker Desktop Stable 2.3.0.2 https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/)
-    From the Docker menu, select Settings > General.
-    Select: Use WSL-2 based engine check box.
-    Select: Enable integration with additional distro
-    Enable: Ubuntu-20.04

 


The setup continues with the following steps:

 


      
Set a path on PowerShell (Windows) 

 

```
cd c:\chemotion\...
```

 

Now, test Docker in your “WSL–2 Ubuntu 20.04“ console session. Open PowerShell console, and execute the following command to check the Docker version

 

```
docker --version
```
Once docker has been running on WSL-2. you could switch to ubutun 20.04 to clone the project https://github.com/ptrxyz/chemotion 

 


Your C: drive is mounted to

 

```
/mnt/c
```
### Optional
Set a path of PostgreSQL on docker-compose.yml 
db:
- /home/chemotion/db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
