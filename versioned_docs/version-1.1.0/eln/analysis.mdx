If open file formats are available, spectra viewers can visualize the data and may allow their editing. Chemotion ELN supports at the moment Chemspectra as data viewer, NMRium is going to be implemented soon.

Chemspectra uses mainly jdx files as input files, but also some special raw files and mz(X)ML files are supported. If none of the suitable file formats are available, one needs to convert the obtained output files to preferably jdx.
