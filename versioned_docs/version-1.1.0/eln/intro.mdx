Due to the necessary complexity of the ELN, it was not always possible to make the functionality of all areas self-explanatory. In this manual we will highlight all the instructions without which it is not possible to operate the ELN or make full use of its capabilities. Before using the ELN, we ask that you at least observe the hints and instructions that are identified by the following symbols for **Caution** and **Recommendation**. The ELN team is available at any time for questions and assistance, but we do assume that you are familiar with this manual and, in particular, with the highlighted **Caution** and **Recommendation**.

All terms in this manual that are highlighted in ** bold ** form designations that can also be found within the user interface.
