cp config/user_props.yml.example config/user_props.yml

# edit it
vim config/user_props.yml

# restart the application (assuming Passenger is being used)
touch tmp/restart.txt

# keep the configuration for future ELN updates (assuming Capistrano is used)
mv config/user_props.yml /var/www/chemotion_ELN/shared/config/user_props.yml
ln -s  /var/www/chemotion_ELN/shared/config/user_props.yml /var/www/chemotion_ELN/current/config/user_props.yml
```

## File collector 

This is an optional service to collect data files and distribute them to the ELN inbox of the respective users.

(see the [devices overview](devices) or [doi: 10.1016/j.acax.2019.100007 ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acax.2019.100007 ))

Two options are available:
- collecting attachment files from emails.
- collecting file or folder from local drives or over scp

### Email-attachement collection 

The ELN-app should be given access to an email account in which it will regularly check for incoming emails and collect the attachments.
The attachments are then distributed to ELN user by matching the additional addressee present in the __To:__ or __CC:__ fied of the email. The sender's email address should also one of an ELN-registered device. 

:::danger 
All new incoming emails are processed and discarded. 
If the sender and other addresssees are unknown to the ELN (emails registered to ELN accounts), then the email will be directly deleted.
:::


### File collection

Files can be collected from remote storages and distributed to specific user based on the file-name matching the user's name abbreviation.

:::danger 
The directories watched by the collector service will be emptied at each collection i.e. all files within the watched directories will be removed.
:::


### Data-collector settings

Configure the frequency for collecting the files, as well as the email access in the config/datacollectors.yml file.
The background worker will collect the files at the frequencies set.
If login credentials are needed, those are set in the configuration file as well.

```sh
### example of configdatacollector.yml 
production:
  :services:
    - :name: 'mailcollector'
      :cron: '5,20,35,50 * * * *' # every 15 minutes starting a xx:05
    - :name: 'folderwatchersftp'
      :every: 5 # minutes
      :watcher_sleep: 30 # seconds
    - :name: 'folderwatcherlocal'
      :every: 5 # minutes
      :watcher_sleep: 30 # seconds
    - :name: 'filewatchersftp'
      :every: 2 # minutes
    - :name: 'filewatcherlocal'
      :every: 2 # minutes

  ## ELN email account
  :mailcollector:
    :server: 'imap.server.de'
    :mail_address: "service@mail"
    :password: "password"
    # :port: 993 default
    # :ssl: true default
    :aliases:
      - 'alias_one@kit.edu'
      - 'alias_two@kit.edu'
  
  ## File collection over ssh with password 
  :sftpusers:
    - :user: 'user1'
      :password: 'pass'
    - :user: 'user2'
      :password: 'pass'

  # Dir of ssh keys for data collection over sftp
  :keydir: 'config/data_collector_keys'

  # Allowlist of dir paths for local data collection
  :localcollectors:
    - :path: '<%= Rails.root.join(*%w[tmp datacollector]).to_s %>'
```

:::info NB
After editing the datacollectors.yml the worker service (DelayedJob) needs to be restarted.
:::

For each registered Device, a collection job can be set up through the administrator interface:
